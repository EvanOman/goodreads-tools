Are you ready?</b><br /><br />Days after winning Oasis founder James Halliday's contest, Wade Watts makes a discovery that changes everything. <br /><br />Hidden within Halliday's vaults, waiting for his heir to find, lies a technological advancement that will once again change the world and make the Oasis a thousand times more wondrous—and addictive—than even Wade dreamed possible. <br /><br />With it comes a new riddle, and a new quest—a last Easter egg from Halliday, hinting at a mysterious prize. <br /><br />And an unexpected, impossibly powerful, and dangerous new rival awaits, one who'll kill millions to get what he wants. <br /><br />Wade's life and the future of the Oasis are again at stake, but this time the fate of humanity also hangs in the balance.<br /><br />Lovingly nostalgic and wildly original as only Ernest Cline could conceive it, <i>Ready Player Two</i> takes us on another imaginative, fun, action-packed adventure through his beloved virtual universe, and jolts us thrillingly into the future once again.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>This legendary account of a voyage around Cape Horn captures the majesty and misadventure of life at sea in the early nineteenth century</b><br /><br />In 1834, nineteen-year-old Richard Henry Dana left Harvard University to enlist as a deckhand on a brig sailing from Boston to the California coast. For the next two years, he recorded the terrifying storms, awe-inspiring beauty, and dreadful hardships of the journey in a diary he would later expand into this riveting memoir of “the life of a common sailor at sea as it really is.”<br /> <br />Dana spares no detail in portraying the wretched conditions he endured and the cruelty of the ship’s captain, but he also paints vivid, unforgettable pictures of natural wonders such as icebergs and schools of migrating whales. His descriptions of the missions and presidios of pre–Gold Rush California captured the imagination of the country when the book was first published in 1840, and they serve as valuable historical documentation to this day.<br /> <br />An instant classic and inspiration for contemporaries such as Herman Melville, <i>Two Years Before the Mast</i> is one of the most remarkable and influential adventure stories in American literature.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In the words of economist and scholar Arnold Kling, Martin Gurri saw it coming.<br /><br />Technology has categorically reversed the information balance of power between the public and the elites who manage the great hierarchical institutions of the industrial age government, political parties, the media.<br /><br />The Revolt of the Public tells the story of how insurgencies, enabled by digital devices and a vast information sphere, have mobilized millions of ordinary people around the world.<br /><br />Originally published in 2014, this updated edition of The Revolt of the Public includes an extensive analysis of Donald Trump's improbable rise to the presidency and the electoral triumphs of Brexit and concludes with a speculative look forward, pondering whether the current elite class can bring about a reformation of the democratic process and whether new organizing principles, adapted to a digital world, can arise out of the present political turbulence.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Why does modern life revolve around objectives? From how science is funded, to improving how children are educated -- and nearly everything in-between -- our society has become obsessed with a seductive that greatness results from doggedly measuring improvement in the relentless pursuit of an ambitious goal. In Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned, Stanley and Lehman begin with a surprising scientific discovery in artificial intelligence that leads ultimately to the conclusion that the objective obsession has gone too far. They make the case that great achievement can't be bottled up into mechanical metrics; that innovation is not driven by narrowly focused heroic effort; and that we would be wiser (and the outcomes better) if instead we whole-heartedly embraced serendipitous discovery and playful creativity.<br /><br />Controversial at its heart, yet refreshingly provocative, this book challenges readers to consider life without a destination and discovery without a compass.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>Nothing to lose. Everything to gain. Winner takes all.</b><br /><br />Lily—a bored, beautiful twentysomething—wakes up on a remote desert compound alongside nineteen other contestants on a popular reality TV show. To win, she must outlast her housemates while competing in challenges for luxury rewards, such as champagne and lipstick, and communal necessities to outfit their new home, like food, appliances, and a front door.<br /><br />The cameras are catching all her angles, good and bad, but Lily has no desire to leave: Why would she, when the world outside is falling apart? As the competition intensifies, intimacy between the players deepens, and it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish between desire and desperation. When the producers raise the stakes, forcing contestants into upsetting, even dangerous situations, the line between playing the game and surviving it begins to blur. If Lily makes it to the end, she'll receive prizes beyond her wildest dreams—but what will she have to do to win?<br /><br />Addictive and prescient, <i>The Compound</i> is an explosive debut from a major new voice in fiction and will linger in your mind long after the game ends.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>WALL STREET JOURNAL BESTSELLER</b><br /><br />The author of the New York Times bestseller <i>You Are the Placebo</i>, as well as <i>Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself</i> and <i>Evolve Your Brain</i>, draws on research conducted at his advanced workshops since 2012 to explore how common people are doing the uncommon to transform themselves and their lives. <br /><br />Becoming Supernatural marries the some of the most profound scientific information with ancient wisdom to show how people like you and me can experience a more mystical life.<br /><br />Readers will learn that we are, quite literally supernatural by nature if given the proper knowledge and instruction, and when we learn how to apply that information through various meditations, we should experience a greater expression of our creative abilities; that we have the capacity to tune in to frequencies beyond our material world and receive more orderly coherent streams of consciousness and energy; that we can intentionally change our brain chemistry to initiate profoundly mystical transcendental experiences; and how, if we do this enough times, we can develop the skill of creating a more efficient, balanced, healthy body, a more unlimited mind, and greater access to the realms of spiritual truth. Topics include:<br /><br /> • Demystifying the body’s 7 energy centers and how you can balance them to heal<br /> • How to free yourself from the past by reconditioning your body to a new mind<br /> • How you can create reality in the generous present moment by changing your energy<br /> • The difference between third-dimension creation and fifth-dimension creation<br /> • The secret science of the pineal gland and its role in accessing mystical realms of reality<br /> • The distinction between Space-Time vs. Time-Space realities<br /><br />And much more...]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The international sensation Iain M. Banks offers readers a deeply imaginative, wittily satirical tale, proving once again that he is "a talent to be reckoned with" ("Locus"). In <i>Excession</i>, the Culture's espionage and dirty tricks section orders Diplomat Byr Gen-Hofoen to steal the soul of a long-dead starship captain. By accepting the mission, Byr irrevocably plunges himself into a conspiracy: one that could either lead the universe into an age of peace or to the brink of annihilation.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Here is the remarkable true story of the real Count of Monte Cristo – a stunning feat of historical sleuthing that brings to life the forgotten hero who inspired such classics as The Count of Monte Cristo and The Three Musketeers. <br /><br />The real-life protagonist of The Black Count, General Alex Dumas, is a man almost unknown today yet with a story that is strikingly familiar, because his son, the novelist Alexandre Dumas, used it to create some of the best loved heroes of literature.<br /><br />Yet, hidden behind these swashbuckling adventures was an even more incredible secret: the real hero was the son of a black slave -- who rose higher in the white world than any man of his race would before our own time. Born in Saint-Domingue (now Haiti), Alex Dumas was briefly sold into bondage but made his way to Paris where he was schooled as a sword-fighting member of the French aristocracy. Enlisting as a private, he rose to command armies at the height of the Revolution in an audacious campaign across Europe and the Middle East – until he met an implacable enemy he could not defeat.<br /><br />The Black Count is simultaneously a riveting adventure story, a lushly textured evocation of 18th-century France, and a window into the modern world’s first multi-racial society. But it is also a heartbreaking story of the enduring bonds of love between a father and son.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The first ever collection of Iain Banks' short fiction, this volume includes the acclaimed novella, The State of the Art. This is a striking addition to the growing body of Culture lore, and adds definition and scale to the previous works by using the Earth of 1977 as contrast. The other stories in the collection range from science fiction to horror, dark-coated fantasy to morality tale. All bear the indefinable stamp of Iain Banks' staggering talent.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>Driven </i>brings a seasoned perspective to today’s conversations about government, media, and the future of truth in the form of a long-awaited autobiography by Tom Johnson, an award-winning journalist who helped shape the twenty-four-hour news media as we know it. Johnson’s storied career in politics and journalism spans the Lyndon B. Johnson administration, where he was privy to painful negotiations on Vietnam and notified the president that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had been assassinated, through the executive leadership of the <i>LA Times </i>and, finally, Ted Turner’s upstart CNN in Atlanta. <br /><br />From his perspective “inside the room,” Johnson provides eyewitness accounts of Lyndon B. Johnson’s triumphs and disasters and his on-the-ground view of the magnificent achievements and significant shortfalls of late twentieth-century American journalism. Johnson is also candid about his lifelong struggle with depression and mental health and recovery advocacy. With more than eight decades behind him, <i>Driven</i> is not just Johnson’s look at the past but a chance for his story to offer guidance about finding balance in an uncertain future.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>
  <i>The world’s most celebrated thriller writer returns with his most stunning novel yet—a propulsive, twisty, thought-provoking masterpiece that will entertain readers as only Dan Brown can do.</i>
</b><br /> <br />Robert Langdon, esteemed professor of symbology, travels to Prague to attend a groundbreaking lecture by Katherine Solomon—a prominent noetic scientist with whom he has recently begun a relationship. Katherine is on the verge of publishing an explosive book that contains startling discoveries about the nature of human consciousness and threatens to disrupt centuries of established belief. But a brutal murder catapults the trip into chaos, and Katherine suddenly disappears along with her manuscript. Langdon finds himself targeted by a powerful organization and hunted by a chilling assailant sprung from Prague’s most ancient mythology. As the plot expands into London and New York, Langdon desperately searches for Katherine . . . and for answers. In a thrilling race through the dual worlds of futuristic science and mystical lore, he uncovers a shocking truth about a secret project that will forever change the way we think about the human mind.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>Falling in love is natural; sustaining love is unnatural. It requires skills that few of us ever learn, plus the effort to put them into practice.</b><br /><br />Drawing on 30 years of following up about what did and didn’t work years after couples took his nationwide “Role Mate to Soul Mate” workshops, <i>The New York Times</i> bestselling author Dr. Warren Farrell solved the two most important barriers to sustaining love: handling personal criticism without becoming defensive; and preventing complacency from replacing passion.<br /><br />In this book, you’ll learn concrete practices to:<br /><br /> 	• Appreciate your loved one with creativity, consistency, and with five levels of specificity<br /> 	• Transform the “Four Depleters of Love” (Criticisms, Complaining, Complacency, and Controlling) into four ways to deepen love<br /> 	• Master the “Eleven Soulmate Wisdoms"<br /> 	• Create and sustain both a “Conflict-free Zone,” plus a “Caring and Sharing Practice” to resolve conflicts.<br /> 	• Play together (“Couples that play together, stay together.”)<br /> 	• Create concrete, win-win solutions to your stickiest problems<br /> 	• Apply your new skills to family, friends, colleagues—and even political opponents<br /><br />Falling in love is natural; sustaining love is unnatural; it requires skills no one learns, and the discipline to implement them. No book blends the art, discipline, and proven concrete practices to overcome the obstacles to a lifelong love better than <i>Role Mate to Soul Mate</i>.]]></book_description>

    <user_review><![CDATA[I signed up to do a relationship workshop at Esalen by Warren. It was recommended highly by a friend, but I didn't know what to expect, other than a weekend escape with my love at a magical place. When I saw the title of the course was something around "Tools to respond to criticism from your partner" we were both like: wow this sounds super useful. And it was. And Warren was just lovely - clearly a master of his craft after teaching this course at Esalen for 20+ years. He finally rolled it all up into this book just last year, but I think if you can manage to take it in person it's probably much more engaging as it's all about workshopping the ideas together.<br /><br />While there is a lot to the book, I will break down a few of the bigger ideas:<br /><br />Creative appreciations: This is about giving appreciations to your partner, the more specific the better. In the workshop he had us create 10-15 that we gave to each other at different moments. This is a habit to build and it is surprisingly hard to do well - it takes a lot of thought to do a good one. "panning for gold" is a good technique where you look for things to appreciate when talking to each other. Post it appreciation notes on the bathroom mirror is another one that can add a nice feng shui to the house. And then there is the "memorable appreciation" where you do one that she will remember in 5 years. We went back to our engagement spot (which conveniently was in Big Sur) for that one. <br /><br />Sharing and caring: This is the key mechanism. When getting defensive in a conversation, instead of criticizing back, hold it, and go journal it. Meditate on it if needed. Then you bring it up in a structured weekly new meeting you have with your partner which Warren calls "Sharing and caring". He give a lot of structure to the meeting so that it's positive and doesn't devolve into arguments. It is required to be a "conflict free zone". If you get triggered in it say "hold" and take a quick break. <br /><br />Music: He played music before each session, and made us dance. While silly, this upped the mood considerably and should probably be in all our repertoire. We made a playlist on Spotify just for this purpose. Games can play a similar role especially in a family.<br /><br />An aside: Warren has other books about gender roles which played into this book in interesting ways, as the societal expectations for men and women are very different. I loved this quote: "The commerce of masculinity is the trading of wit."]]></user_review>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The last book published during Kafka's lifetime, <i>A Hunger Artist</i> (1924) explores many of the themes that were close to him: spiritual poverty, asceticism, futility, and the alienation of the modern artist. <br /><br />He edited the manuscript just before his death, and these four stories are some of his best known and most powerful work, marking his maturity as a writer. In addition to "First Sorrow," "A Little Woman," and "Josephine the Singer, or the Mouse People" is the title story, "A Hunger Artist," which has been called by the critic Heinz Politzer "a perfection, a fatal fulfillment that expresses Kafka's desire for permanence." <br /><br />The three volumes Twisted Spoon Press has published: <i>Contemplation</i>, <i>A Country Doctor</i>, and <i>A Hunger Artist</i> are the collections of stories that Kafka had published during his lifetime. Though each volume has its own distinctive character, they have most often appeared in English in collected editions. They are presented here as separate editions, in new translations by Kevin Blahut, each with its own illustrator from the Prague community.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The Earth teems with life: in its oceans, forests, skies and cities. Yet there’s a black hole at the heart of biology. We do not know why complex life is the way it is, or, for that matter, how life first began. In <em>The Vital Question</em>, award-winning author and biochemist Nick Lane radically reframes evolutionary history, putting forward a solution to conundrums that have puzzled generations of scientists.<br /><br />For two and a half billion years, from the very origins of life, single-celled organisms such as bacteria evolved without changing their basic form. Then, on just one occasion in four billion years, they made the jump to complexity. All complex life, from mushrooms to man, shares puzzling features, such as sex, which are unknown in bacteria. How and why did this radical transformation happen?<br /><br />The answer, Lane argues, lies in energy: all life on Earth lives off a voltage with the strength of a lightning bolt. Building on the pillars of evolutionary theory, Lane’s hypothesis draws on cutting-edge research into the link between energy and cell biology, in order to deliver a compelling account of evolution from the very origins of life to the emergence of multicellular organisms, while offering deep insights into our own lives and deaths.<br /><br />Both rigorous and enchanting, <em>The Vital Question</em> provides a solution to life’s vital question: why are we as we are, and indeed, why are we here at all?]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Named one of Financial Times’s Best Books of 2025 New York Times reporter and bestselling author David Gelles reveals how Patagonia became a global leader in doing well by doing good and how other companies are adopting its principles. This is the inside story of one of the most extraordinary brands in the corporate world, the rare company that is driven by environmental activism instead of cutthroat capitalism. Founded in 1973, Patagonia has grown into a wildly popular producer of jackets, hats, and fleece vests, with a cultlike following among hardcore alpinists and Wall Street traders alike, posting sales of more than $1 billion a year. But it’s not just the clothes that make Patagonia unique. For decades, the company has distinguished itself as a singular beacon for socially responsible business, the rare company that can legitimately claim to be doing its damnedest to make the world a better place, while also making a profit. From its early efforts to take exemplary care of its employees, to its extensive work trying to clean up its supply chain, to its controversial activism, Patagonia has set itself apart from its peers with one unorthodox decision after another, proving that there is another way to do capitalism. At the heart of the story is Patagonia’s founder, the legendary rock climber Yvon Chouinard. A perennial outsider who forged one of the most impressive resumes in the outdoor world, Chouinard also established himself as a pivotal figure in the history of American business. Guided by his anti-authoritarian streak and his unwavering commitment to preserving the natural world, Patagonia came to exert a powerful influence on other companies, paving the way for a new era of social and environmental responsibility. He started out as a dirtbag—a term affectionately bestowed on poor, itinerant outdoorsmen so uninterested in material possessions they are happy to sleep in the dirt—and he became a billionaire. Chouinard also proved that there was another way to be a philanthropist. In the twilight of his career, he gave away Patagonia, renouncing his wealth and committing all its future profits to fighting the climate crisis. Drawing on exclusive access to Chouinard and the Patagonia team, Dirtbag Billionaire offers new insights into the key moments that informed their priorities, shaped the company, and sent ripples across the corporate world.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Equal parts <i>Sapiens, Behave,</i> and <i>Superintelligence</i>, but wholly original in scope, <i>A Brief History of Intelligence</i> offers a paradigm shift for how we understand neuroscience and AI. Artificial intelligence entrepreneur Max Bennett chronicles the five “breakthroughs” in the evolution of human intelligence and reveals what brains of the past can tell us about the AI of tomorrow. In the last decade, capabilities of artificial intelligence that had long been the realm of science fiction have, for the first time, become our reality. AI is now able to produce original art, identify tumors in pictures, and even steer our cars. And yet, large gaps remain in what modern AI systems can achieve—indeed, human brains still easily perform intellectual feats that we can’t replicate in AI systems. How is it possible that AI can beat a grandmaster at chess but can’t effectively load a dishwasher? As AI entrepreneur Max Bennett compellingly argues, finding the answer requires diving into the billion-year history of how the human brain evolved; a history filled with countless half-starts, calamities, and clever innovations. Not only do our brains have a story to tell—the future of AI may depend on it. Now, in <i>A Brief History of Intelligence</i>, Bennett bridges the gap between neuroscience and AI to tell the brain’s evolutionary story, revealing how understanding that story can help shape the next generation of AI breakthroughs. Deploying a fresh perspective and working with the support of many top minds in neuroscience, Bennett consolidates this immense history into an approachable new framework, identifying the “Five Breakthroughs” that mark the brain’s most important evolutionary leaps forward. Each breakthrough brings new insight into the biggest mysteries of human intelligence. Containing fascinating corollaries to developments in AI, <i>A Brief History of Intelligence</i> shows where current AI systems have matched or surpassed our brains, as well as where AI systems still fall short. Simply put, until AI systems successfully replicate each part of our brain’s long journey, AI systems will fail to exhibit human-like intelligence. Endorsed and lauded by many of the top neuroscientists in the field today, Bennett’s work synthesizes the most relevant scientific knowledge and cutting-edge research into an easy-to-understand and riveting evolutionary story. With sweeping scope and stunning insights, <i>A Brief History of Intelligence</i>  proves that understanding the arc of our brain’s history can unlock the tools for successfully navigating our technological future. ]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[From the bestselling author of Too Big to Fail, “the definitive history of the 2008 banking crisis,”* comes a spellbinding narrative of the most infamous stock market crash in history. With the depth of a classic history and the drama of a thriller, 1929 unravels the greed, blind optimism, and human folly that led to an era-defining collapse—one with ripple effects that still shape our society today.<br /><br />In 1929, the world watched in shock as the unstoppable Wall Street bull market went into a freefall, wiping out fortunes and igniting a depression that would reshape a generation. But behind the flashing ticker tapes and panicked traders, another drama unfolded—one of visionaries and fraudsters, titans and dreamers, euphoria and ruin.<br /><br />With unparalleled access to historical records and newly uncovered documents, New York Times bestselling author Andrew Ross Sorkin takes readers inside the chaos of the crash, behind the scenes of a raging battle between Wall Street and Washington and the larger-than-life characters whose ambition and naivete in an endless boom led to disaster. The dizzying highs and brutal lows of this era eerily mirror today’s world—where markets soar, political tensions mount, and the fight over financial influence plays out once again.<br /><br />This is not just a story about money. 1929 is a tale of power, psychology, and the seductive illusion that “this time is different.” It’s about disregarded alarm bells, financiers who fell from grace, and skeptics who saw the crash coming—only to be dismissed until it was too late.<br /><br />Hailed as a landmark book, Too Big to Fail reimagined how financial crises are told. Now, with 1929, Sorkin delivers an immersive, electrifying account of the most pivotal market collapse of all time—with lessons that remain as urgent as ever. More than just a history, 1929 is a crucial blueprint for understanding the cycles of speculation, the forces that drive financial upheaval, and the warning signs we ignore at our peril.<br /><br />*The Atlantic Monthly]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[A grand mystery reaching back centuries. A sensational disappearance that made headlines around the world. A quest for truth that leads to death, madness or disappearance for those who seek to solve it. <i>The Lost City of Z</i> is a blockbuster adventure narrative about what lies beneath the impenetrable jungle canopy of the Amazon.<br /><br />After stumbling upon a hidden trove of diaries, New Yorker writer David Grann set out to solve "the greatest exploration mystery of the 20th century": What happened to the British explorer Percy Fawcett &amp; his quest for the Lost City of Z?<br /><br />In 1925, Fawcett ventured into the Amazon to find an ancient civilization, hoping to make one of the most important discoveries in history. For centuries Europeans believed the world's largest jungle concealed the glittering kingdom of El Dorado. Thousands had died looking for it, leaving many scientists convinced that the Amazon was truly inimical to humans. But Fawcett, whose daring expeditions inspired Conan Doyle's <i>The Lost World</i>, had spent years building his scientific case. Captivating the imagination of millions round the globe, Fawcett embarked with his 21-year-old son, determined to prove that this ancient civilisation--which he dubbed Z--existed. Then his expedition vanished. Fawcett's fate, &amp; the tantalizing clues he left behind about Z, became an obsession for hundreds who followed him into the uncharted wilderness. <br /><br />For decades scientists &amp; adventurers have searched for evidence of Fawcett's party &amp; the lost City of Z. Countless have perished, been captured by tribes or gone mad. As Grann delved ever deeper into the mystery surrounding Fawcett's quest, &amp; the greater mystery of what lies within the Amazon, he found himself, like the generations who preceded him, being irresistibly drawn into the jungle's green hell. His quest for the truth &amp; discoveries about Fawcett's fate &amp; Z form the heart of this complexly enthralling narrative.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Finalist for The Next Big Idea Bookclub • Book of the Year Selection Behavioral Scientist and Greater Good Society<br /><br />“This is perhaps the richest book on belonging you’ll ever read.… The inspiration one draws from every page of this book is an enhanced sense of what is possible. It revives the very thing we need most in these hope.” ―Claude M. Steele, author of Whistling Vivaldi Discover the secret to flourishing in an age of belonging. In a world filled with discord and loneliness, finding harmony and happiness can be difficult. But what if the key to unlocking our potential lies in this deceptively simple concept? Belonging is the feeling of being a part of a group that values, respects, and cares for us―a feeling that we can all cultivate in even the smallest corners of social life. In The Science of Creating Connection and Bridging Divides , Stanford University professor Geoffrey L. Cohen draws on his own and others’ groundbreaking scientific research to offer simple, concrete solutions for fostering a sense of belonging. These solutions can generate surprisingly significant and long-lasting benefits. Small but powerful actions can bolster belonging―actions such as encouraging people to reflect on their core values before they face a challenge or expressing belief in someone’s capacity to reach a higher standard. A wide range of innovative approaches have been found to boost achievement at work and at school, bridge political divides, reduce prejudice, and even contribute to overall health. Rigorously tested in diverse arenas―from classrooms to disadvantaged neighborhoods to iconic Silicon Valley companies―these methods offer a path forward in these demanding times. Belonging is a compelling read for all who yearn for a more connected world, whether you’re a manager or employee, an educator or student, a parent or caregiver, or simply someone seeking to make the most out of every moment you spend with others. Packed with actionable insights and specific strategies, this book offers hope and practical guidance, serving as both an inspiration and a roadmap to creating a world of inclusion, understanding, and empathy.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>A thought-provoking exploration of the four major commitments in life that fundamentally shape our identities--from the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Road to Character</i>.</b><br /><br />Most of us, over the course of our lives, will make four big commitments: to a <b>spouse and family</b>, to a <b>vocation</b>, to a <b>philosophy or faith</b>, and to a <b>community</b>. Our personal fulfillment depends on how well we choose and execute these commitments. Joy comes when we fuse them into one coherent whole, with each of these commitments fortifying and strengthening the others. In<i> The Committed Life, </i>David Brooks looks at people--from Dostoyevsky to Holocaust survivor Etty Hillesum to African educational entrepreneur Fred Swaniker--who have lived joyous, committed lives, and who have embraced the necessity of dependence. He gathers their wisdom on how to choose a partner, how to pick a vocation, how to live out a philosophy, and how we can begin to integrate our commitments into one overriding purpose.<br /><br />In short, this book is meant to help us all lead more meaningful lives. But it's also a provocative social commentary. We live in a society, Brooks argues, that celebrates freedom and choice, that tells us to be true to ourselves, to march to the beat of our own drummer at the expense of surrendering to a cause, rooting ourselves in a neighborhood, and binding ourselves to others by social solidarity and love. We have taken individualism to the extreme degree--and, in the process, we have torn the social fabric in a thousand different ways. The path to repair is through making deeper commitments.<br /><br /><i>The Social Animal</i> gave us a tale of human nature. <i>The Road to Character</i> traced the history of a great moral tradition--a riveting examination of morality in our time, but with <i>The Committed Life</i>, Brooks turns his mind to what happens when we put commitment-making at the center of life, producing one of Brooks' most personal and revolutionary books yet.]]></book_description>

    <user_review><![CDATA[I read and re-read this all summer. One of the best books I've read on life and purpose. I've been quoting it for years actually but was due for a repeat due to being in a life transition. The book presents a powerful metaphor for the transition to one of life's biggest stages: from the first mountain, or money/work/success, to the second mountain, or purpose/meaning. <br /><br /><blockquote>
  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/notes/41023090-the-second-mountain/1-otis-chandler/6dd360be-1212-447d-9dbe-f011ac042906?ref=rnlp" rel="nofollow noopener">The first mountain is the individualist worldview, which puts the desires of the ego at the center. The second mountain is what you might call the relationalist worldview, which puts relation, commitment, and the desires of the heart and soul at the center.</a>
</blockquote><br /><br />Most people spend most of their post school lives on the first mountain, and only encounter the second mountain upon retirement. Some people, are lucky enough to encounter it earlier in life. In 2019 I left my job (and my baby, Goodreads) and moved to France to figure out life. I learned about La Bonne Vie - or "the good life" - but that doesn't translate well - what I found was that France was a place where people's identities were centered not primarily their jobs, but rather other things: their hobbies, their families, their friends, their "life". This was a vast difference from the SF bay area where your identity is your work. And I was so grateful to experience life in that world - I really grew as a person. And yet, it was only a step towards the second mountain. <br /><br />Because my big insight in reading this book has been that second mountain is not just about purpose, but about helping others and building community. (Something I know something about as those were core to building Goodreads!) But the switch is when your mission isn't the meritocratic ladder we live in on the first mountain - career, money, success - but your mission is to help others. Some people are nobly on missions like this early in life. But most of us view that as a "thing I'll do when I'm older and I've 'made it'". <br /><br />Brooks gives a lot of good examples of what some people's journey to the second mountain looks like. But frankly, I'd love a whole second book about that, as there are so many paths, and so many variables. I did like his tip to catalogue your passions whenever you have them. <br /><br />Brooks makes an interesting argument in the book that our society oscillates in the long term between individualism and conformity. Eg post WWII we were conformists, and in the 60s an individualistic cycle broke out. Today, he argues that with all the tech isolating us and dividing us, we are in a strong and dangerous individual cycle, and we need to work back to a society that has stronger community. This seems clear and very true to me once you lay out that way, and I fear that before it makes it better, AI will make it worse. <br /><br /><blockquote>Consumerism amputates what is central to the person for the sake of material acquisition. The meritocracy amputates what is deepest for individual “success.” Unbalanced capitalism turns people into utility-maximizing, speeding workaholics that no permanent attachment can penetrate.</blockquote><br /><br />Too many of us are living first mountain lives and not realizing there is more to life. Easy to say, because unless you are retiring it is very hard to get off the first mountain. But it is good to recognize what it is and what it does to us. Two good quotes on that:<br /><br /><blockquote>Furthermore, workaholism is a surprisingly effective distraction from emotional and spiritual problems. It’s surprisingly easy to become emotionally avoidant and morally decoupled, to be less close to and vulnerable with those around you, to wall off the dark jungle deep inside you, to gradually tamp down the highs and lows and simply live in neutral.</blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote>The meritocracy gives you brands to attach to—your prestigious school, your nice job title—which work well as status markers and seem to replace the urgent need to find out who you are. Work, the poet David Whyte writes, “is a place you can lose yourself more easily perhaps than finding yourself.”</blockquote><br /><br />My time in France was about entering the valley between the mountains and start to understand what they are about. I started to realize that there were other things in life that were important, even though the the pull to go back to SF and "work in tech" was (and is) a strong draw. <br /><br /><blockquote>We are often taught by our culture that we are primarily thinking beings—Homo sapiens. Sometimes our schools and companies treat us as nothing but analytic brains. But when we’re in the valley, we get a truer and deeper view of who we really are and what we really need. When we’re in the valley our view of what’s important in life is transformed. We begin to realize that the reasoning brain is actually the third most important part of our consciousness. The first and most important part is the desiring heart.</blockquote><br /><br />I think we are at a unique moment in time because we are at the leading edge of a massive societal shift: AI. This give us the opportunity to shift our society to the second mountain values that really matter: our relationships with others. I have heard many people cite studies of people on their death beds saying what they valued most in their lives, and it wasn't their meritocratic successes, it was the relationships they built in life. Their families, their friends, their communities. <br /><br /><blockquote>We often assume that self-interest—defined as material gain and status recognition—are the main desires of life and that service to others is the icing on the cake. And that’s because for centuries most of our social thinking has been shaped by men, who went out and competed in the world while women largely stayed home and did the caring. These men didn’t even see the activity that undergirded the political and economic systems they spent their lives studying. But when you actually look around the world—parents looking after their kids, neighbors forming associations, colleagues helping one another, people meeting and encountering each other in coffee shops—you see that loving care is not on the fringe of society. It’s the foundation of society.</blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote>As adults, we measure our lives by the quality of our relationships and the quality of our service to those relationships. Life is a qualitative endeavor, not a quantitative one. It’s not how many, but how thick and how deep.</blockquote><br /><br />I very much look forward to my second mountain journey.]]></user_review>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>From the Senior Scholar-in-residence and Ambassador for the famed Kripalu Center for Yoga and Health comes an incisive and inspiring meditation on living the life you were born to live.</b>   In this fast-paced age, the often overwhelming realities of daily life may leave you feeling uncertain about how to realize your life’s true purpose—what spiritual teachers call dharma. But yoga master Stephen Cope says that in order to have a fulfilling life you must, in fact, discover the deep purpose hidden at the very core of your self. In The Great Work of Your Life, Cope describes the process of unlocking the unique possibility harbored within every human soul. The secret, he asserts, can be found in the pages of a two-thousand-year-old spiritual classic called the Bhagavad Gita—an ancient allegory about the path to dharma, told through a timeless dialogue between the fabled archer, Arjuna, and his divine mentor, Krishna.   Cope takes readers on a step-by-step tour of this revered tale, and in order to make it relevant to contemporary readers, he highlights well-known Western lives that embody its central principles—including such luminaries as Jane Goodall, whose life trajectory shows us the power of honoring The Gift; Walt Whitman, who listened for the call of the times; Susan B. Anthony, whose example demonstrates the power of focused energy; John Keats, who was able to let his desire give birth to aspiration; and Harriet Tubman, whose life was nothing if not a lesson in learning to walk by faith. This essential guide also includes everyday stories about following the path to dharma, which illustrate the astonishingly contemporary relevance and practicality of this classic yogic story.   If you’re feeling lost in your own life’s journey, The Great Work of Your Life may provide you with answers to the questions you most urgently need addressed—and may help you to find and to embrace your true calling.<b>Praise for The Great Work of Your Life </b><b>   </b> “Keep a pen and paper handy as you read this remarkable It’s like an owner’s manual for the soul.”<b>—Dani Shapiro, author of Devotion</b>  “A masterwork . . . You’ll find inspiration in these pages. You’ll gain a better appreciation of divine guidance and perhaps even understand how you might better hear it in your own life.”<b>—Yoga Journal</b>  “I am moved and inspired by this book, the clarity and beauty of the lives lived in it, and the timeless dharma it teaches.”<b>—Jack Kornfield, author of A Path with Heart</b>  “A rich source of contemplation and inspiration [that] encourages readers . . . to discover and fully pursue their inner self’s calling.”<b>—Publishers Weekly</b>   “Fabulous . . . If you have ever wondered what your purpose is, this book is a great guide to help you on your path.”<b>—YogaHara</b>From the Hardcover edition.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>An audacious, darkly glittering novel set in the eerie days of civilization’s collapse, <i>Station Eleven</i> tells the spellbinding story of a Hollywood star, his would-be savior, and a nomadic group of actors roaming the scattered outposts of the Great Lakes region, risking everything for art and humanity.</b><br /><br />Kirsten Raymonde will never forget the night Arthur Leander, the famous Hollywood actor, had a heart attack on stage during a production of King Lear. That was the night when a devastating flu pandemic arrived in the city, and within weeks, civilization as we know it came to an end.<br /><br />Twenty years later, Kirsten moves between the settlements of the altered world with a small troupe of actors and musicians. They call themselves The Traveling Symphony, and they have dedicated themselves to keeping the remnants of art and humanity alive. But when they arrive in St. Deborah by the Water, they encounter a violent prophet who will threaten the tiny band’s existence. And as the story takes off, moving back and forth in time, and vividly depicting life before and after the pandemic, the strange twist of fate that connects them all will be revealed.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>The propulsive, shockingly plausible sequel to <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Daemon</i>, the "Greatest. Techno-thriller. Period."*<br />*William O'Brien, former director of cybersecurity and communications systems policy at the White House</b><br /><br />2009 saw one of the most inventive techno-thriller debuts in decades as Daniel Suarez introduced his terrifying and tantalizing vision of a new world order. <i>Daemon</i> captured the attention of the tech community, became a national bestseller, garnered attention from futurists, literary critics, and the halls of government-leaving readers clamoring for the conclusion to Suarez's epic story.<br /><br />In the opening chapters of <i>Freedom™</i>, the Daemon is well on its way toward firm control of the modern world, using an expanded network of real-world, dispossessed darknet operatives to tear apart civilization and rebuild it anew. Civil war breaks out in the American Midwest, with the mainstream media stoking public fear in the face of this "Corn Rebellion." Former detective Pete Sebeck, now the Daemon's most famous and most reluctant operative, must lead a small band of enlightened humans in a populist movement designed to protect the new world order.<br /><br />But the private armies of global business are preparing to crush the Daemon once and for all. In a world of conflicted loyalties, rapidly diminishing government control, and a new choice between free will and the continuing comforts of ignorance, the stakes could not be higher: hanging in the balance is nothing less than democracy's last hope to survive the technology revolution.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In 1945, at the end of World War II, Adolf Eichmann, the head of operations for the Nazis' Final Solution, walked into the mountains of Germany and vanished from view. Sixteen years later, an elite team of spies captured him at a bus stop in Argentina and smuggled him to Israel, resulting in one of the century's most important trials -- one that cemented the Holocaust in the public imagination.<br /><br />This is the thrilling and fascinating story of what happened between these two events. Illustrated with powerful photos throughout, impeccably researched, and told with powerful precision, THE NAZI HUNTERS is a can't-miss work of narrative nonfiction for middle-grade and YA readers.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[On the other side of the life you are trying to keep together, on the other side of the pain you think will never dissolve into peace, on the other side of everything you are forcing—is the life that is waiting. The life where you are not pushed by your fears, but moved by your vision. The life where the right things arrive, and remain, and you do not have to contort your truth to make them so. The life where you are actually living, not just waiting to begin. The life that is really yours. The life you arrive to the end of with tired eyes and a full heart. The life that you are proud of. The life that you actually want The life that is gently asking you to let go, and see it. The life that's been waiting, all this time, for you to arrive.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Big data entrepreneur Allen Gannett overturns the mythology around creative genius, and reveals the science and secrets behind achieving breakout commercial success in any field.<br /> <br />We have been spoon-fed the notion that creativity is the province of genius -- of those favored, brilliant few whose moments of insight arrive in unpredictable flashes of divine inspiration. And if we are not a genius, we might as well pack it in and give up. Either we have that gift, or we don’t. But Allen shows that simply isn’t true. Recent research has shown that there is a predictable science behind achieving commercial success in any creative endeavor, from writing a popular novel to starting up a successful company to creating an effective marketing campaign. <br /> <br />As the world’s most creative people have discovered, we are enticed by the novel and the familiar. By understanding the mechanics of what Gannett calls “the creative curve” – the point of optimal tension between the novel and the familiar – everyone can better engineer mainstream success. <br /> <br />In a thoroughly entertaining book that describes the stories and insights of everyone from the Broadway team behind Dear Evan Hansen , to the founder of Reddit, from the Chief Content Officer of Netflix to Michelin star chefs, Gannett reveals the four laws of creative success and identifies the common patterns behind their achievement.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>From the iconic internationally bestselling author of the <i>Crazy Rich Asians</i> trilogy: A forbidden affair erupts volcanically amid a decadent tropical wedding in this outrageous comedy of manners from the iconic author of <i>Crazy Rich Asians</i>.</b><br /><br />Rufus Leung Gresham, future Earl of Greshambury and son of a former Hong Kong supermodel has a problem: the legendary Gresham Trust has been depleted by decades of profligate spending, and behind all the magazine covers and Instagram stories manors and yachts lies nothing more than a gargantuan mountain of debt. The only solution, put forth by Rufus’s scheming mother, is for Rufus to attend his sister’s wedding at a luxury eco-resort, a veritable who’s-who of sultans, barons, and oligarchs, and seduce a woman with money.<br /><br />Should he marry Solène de Courcy, a French hotel heiress with honey blond tresses and a royal bloodline? Should he pursue Martha Dung, the tattooed venture capital genius who passes out billions like lollipops? Or should he follow his heart, betray his family, squander his legacy, and finally confess his love to the literal girl next door, the humble daughter of a doctor, Eden Tong? When a volcanic eruption burns through the nuptials and a hot mic exposes a secret tryst, the Gresham family plans—and their reputation—go up in flames.<br /><br />Can the once-great dukedom rise from the ashes? Or will a secret tragedy, hidden for two decades, reveal a shocking twist?<br /><br />In a globetrotting tale that takes us from the black sand beaches of Hawaii to the skies of Marrakech, from the glitzy bachelor pads of Los Angeles to the inner sanctums of England’s oldest family estates, Kevin Kwan unfurls a juicy, hilarious, sophisticated and thrillingly plotted story of love, money, murder, sex, and the lies we tell about them all.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<p> </p><p>Naguib Mahfouz’s magnificent epic trilogy of colonial Egypt appears here in one volume for the first time. The Nobel Prize—winning writer’s masterwork is the engrossing story of a Muslim family in Cairo during Britain’s occupation of Egypt in the early decades of the twentieth century.</p><p> </p><p>The novels of <i>The Cairo Trilogy</i> trace three generations of the family of tyrannical patriarch Al-Sayyid Ahmad Abd al-Jawad, who rules his household with a strict hand while living a secret life of self-indulgence. <i>Palace Walk</i> introduces us to his gentle, oppressed wife, Amina, his cloistered daughters, Aisha and Khadija, and his three sons–the tragic and idealistic Fahmy, the dissolute hedonist Yasin, and the soul-searching intellectual Kamal. Al-Sayyid Ahmad’s rebellious children struggle to move beyond his domination in <i>Palace of Desire</i>, as the world around them opens to the currents of modernity and political and domestic turmoil brought by the 1920s. <i>Sugar Street</i> brings Mahfouz’s vivid tapestry of an evolving Egypt to a dramatic climax as the aging patriarch sees one grandson become a Communist, one a Muslim fundamentalist, and one the lover of a powerful politician.</p><p> </p><p>Throughout the trilogy, the family’s trials mirror those of their turbulent country during the years spanning the two World Wars, as change comes to a society that has resisted it for centuries. Filled with compelling drama, earthy humor, and remarkable insight, <i>The Cairo Trilogy</i> is the achievement of a master storyteller.</p>]]></book_description>

It followed one family and thus had many ups and downs, but what made me stick with it was Mahfouz painted his characters so incredibly well, they really came alive. <br /><br />Book 1 was hard to read because the father was so cruel to his wife and kids. He never let his wife leave the house, he was stern and authoritative with his kids, yet he would go out and drink and womanize with friends every night. Incredible to me that such a dichotomy existed. But over the generations it painted a picture of life in Egypt, and how they dealt with the changing times. <br /><br />"The truth was that he was dreaded and feared only in his own family. With everyone else – friends, acquaintances, and customers – he was a different person. He received his share of respect and esteem but above all else was loved. He was loved for the charm of his personality more than for any of his many other fine characteristics. His acquaintances did not know what he was like at home. The members of his family did not know him as others did."<br /><br />"With the same ardent, overflowing vitality, he opened his breast to the joys and pleasures of life. He delighted in fancy food. He was enchanted by vintage wine. He was crazy about a pretty face. He pursued each of these pleasures with gaiety, joy, and passion. His conscience was not weighed down by guilty feelings or anxious scruples. He was exercising a right granted him by life, as though there was no conflict between the duty life gave his heart and the duty God entrusted to his conscience."<br /><br />Poor Kamal: <br />"He gazed at her, and her personal magnetism attracted his emotions so totally that he lost all sense of time, place, people, and self. He was once more reduced to a spirit swimming through the void toward his beloved. He perceived her – more with his spirit than his senses – in an enchanting intoxication, a musical rapture, and a lofty splendor. His sight grew weak and feeble. The force of his spiritual reaction seemed to have affected all his vital functions. Thus his senses and his faculties were transported to a semiconscious state approaching annihilation."<br /><br />One interesting bit was that for a muslim country, alcohol featured quite prominently in the book. And then ruined the health of the father and the sons when they consistently used it too much. It really is one of the hardest sins to avoid in every culture. ]]></user_review>

    <book_description><![CDATA[This gem of a book explains in a simple and easy manner the process of self muscle testing. Self muscle testing is a technique similar to that of applied kinesiology, a technique that people use to gain insight into their own body and mind's healing process. The aim of this book is to empower the reader so that they can begin conducting accurate and reliable self muscle testing as soon as possible.<br /><br />Not all humans have the capacity to accurately self muscle test and this book goes into how to set up the ideal conditions so that this valuable tool can be accessed on a regular and consistent basis. The more people that can successfully self muscle test, the better it is for all beings because muscle testing has the potential to rapidly enhance ones ability to “know thy self.”<br /><br />In this book you will learn about:<br />- The pre-requisites for self muscle testing<br />- How to "Switch on" for accurate testing<br />- How to test without bias<br />- How to test health products, supplements and foods<br />- Some more advanced techniques<br />- and more...]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[在技术进步和经济不断发展的当下，越来越多的人开始思考这些问题：当机器人能够顺畅地处理大部分工作时，是否会导致人类大量失业？在大量失业的情况下，人们该如何获得收入，是否会因此感到人生毫无意义，丧失获得快乐的能力？ 假设人类安全地开发出了超级智能，对它进行了良好的管理，并很好地利用了这项技术所能释放的巨大经济潜力和神奇的变革力量。在这个世界中，人工智能可以做我们能做的一切，而且可以做得更好、更快，成本更低。那么，人类还能扮演什么角色呢？ 这本书前瞻性地探索了科技高度发达的“未来之地”，并预测了超级智能时代的人类命运，它探讨的是一个后技术时代的新问题：一旦到达梦想中的技术之巅，人类要如何培养意义和目的？如果不再需要工作，我们将如何生活？ 作者在书中部分采用了对话体的形式，创造性地虚构了一个为期一周的哲学系列讲座的场景，由博斯特罗姆教授本人主讲。此外，作者还构建了一个动物世界寻找乌托邦的寓言场景，以此映射人类世界，新颖有趣，有助于读者快速进入作者的哲学场域。]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[A leader in transpersonal psychology presents the first truly integrative model of spiritual consciousness and Western developmental psychology<br /><br />The goal of an “integral psychology” is to honor and embrace every legitimate aspect of human consciousness under one roof. Drawing on hundreds of sources—Eastern and Western, ancient and modern—Wilber creates a psychological model that includes waves of development, streams of development, states of consciousness, and the self, and follows the course of each from subconscious to self-conscious to superconscious.<br /><br />Included in the book are charts correlating over a hundred psychological and spiritual schools from around the world, including Kabbalah, Vedanta, Plotinus, Teresa of Ávila, Aurobindo, Theosophy, and modern theorists such as Jean Piaget, Erik Erikson, Jane Loevinger, Lawrence Kohlberg, Carol Gilligan, Erich Neumann, and Jean Gebser. Integral Psychology is Wilber's most ambitious psychological system to date and is already being called a landmark study in human development.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>So You Too Can:<br />- Move to a South Pacific Island<br />- Wear a Loincloth<br />- Read a Hundred Books<br />- Diaper a Baby Monkey<br />- Build a Bungalow<br /><br />And Maybe, Just Maybe, Fall in Love! *<br /><br />* Individual results may vary. Baby monkey not included.<br /><br /><i>The true story of how a quarter-life crisis led to adventure, freedom, and love on a tiny island in the Pacific.</i></b><br /><br /><i>From the author of a lot of emails and several Facebook posts comes </i>A Beginner’s Guide to Paradise<i>, a laugh-out-loud, true story that will answer your most pressing escape-from-it-all questions, including:</i><br /><br />1. How much, per pound, should you expect to pay a priest to fly you to the outer islands of Yap?<br />2. Classic slumber party stumper: If you could have just one movie on a remote Pacific island, what would it definitely not be?<br />3. How do you blend fruity drinks without a blender?<br />4. Is a free, one-hour class from Home Depot on “Flowerbox Construction” sufficient training to build a house?<br /><br />From <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> to <i>Survivor</i>, <i>Gilligan’s Island </i>to <i>The Beach</i>, people have fantasized about living on a remote tropical island. But when facing a quarter-life crisis, plucky desk slave Alex Sheshunoff actually did it.<br /><br />While out in Paradise, he learned a lot. About how to make big choices and big changes. About the less-than-idyllic parts of paradise. About tying a loincloth without exposing the tender bits. Now, Alex shares his incredible story and pretty-hard-won wisdom in a book that will surprise you, make you laugh, take you to such unforgettable islands as Yap and Pig, and perhaps inspire your own move to an island with only two letters in its name.<br /><br /><i>Answers: 1) $1.14 2) Gas Attack Training Made Simple 3) Crimp a fork in half and insert middle into power drill 4) No.</i><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>From the bestselling author of <i>Thinking in Bets </i>comes a toolkit for mastering the skill of quitting to achieve greater success</b><br /><br />Business leaders, with millions of dollars down the drain, struggle to abandon a new app or product that just isn't working. Governments, caught in a hopeless conflict, believe that the next tactic will finally be the one that wins the war. And in our own lives, we persist in relationships or careers that no longer serve us. Why? According to Annie Duke, in the face of tough decisions, we're terrible quitters. And that is significantly holding us back.<br /><br />In <i>Quit</i>, Duke teaches you how to get good at quitting. Drawing on stories from elite athletes like Mount Everest climbers, founders of leading companies like Stewart Butterfield, the CEO of Slack, and top entertainers like Dave Chappelle, Duke explains why quitting is integral to success, as well as strategies for determining when to hold em, and when to fold em, that will save you time, energy, and money. You'll learn: <br />How the paradox of quitting influences decision making: <i>If you quit on time, you will feel you quit early</i><br />What forces work against good quitting behavior, such as escalation commitment, desire for certainty, and status quo biasHow to think in expected value in order to make better decisions, as well as other best practices, such as increasing flexibility in goal-setting, establishing "quitting contracts," anticipating optionality, and conducting premortems and backcasts<br />Whether you're facing a make-or-break business decision or life-altering personal choice, mastering the skill of quitting will help you make the best next move.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[A deeply reported business history of the chip-designer Nvidia—from its founding in 1993 to its recent emergence as one of the most valuable corporations in the world—explaining how the company’s culture, overseen by cofounder and CEO Jensen Huang, has powered its incredible success.<br /><br />Nvidia is the darling of the age of artificial intelligence: its chips are powering the generative-AI revolution, and demand is insatiable. For all the current interest and attention, however, Nvidia is not of our time. Founded more than three decades ago in a Denny’s in East San Jose, for years it was known primarily in the then-niche world of computer gaming. In fact, the company’s leather-jacketed leader, Jensen Huang, is the longest-serving CEO in an industry marked by near constant turmoil and failure.<br /><br />In <em>The Nvidia Way</em>, acclaimed tech writer Tae Kim draws on more than one hundred interviews—including Jensen (as he is known) and his cofounders, the two original venture capital investors, early former employees, and current senior executives—to show how Nvidia played the longest of long games, repeatedly creating new markets and outmaneuvering competitors, including the original semiconductor giant, Intel, which now finds itself well behind the upstart. Kim offers revelations at every step, among them:<br /><br />• An authoritative, myth-busting account of Nvidia’s founding in 1993.<br />How Nvidia managed to overcome early missteps that would have killed most start-ups.<br />• The benefits of Nvidia’s flat organizational structure, which allows even low-level employees to contribute to the direction of the company.<br />• How Jensen’s obsession with solving the Innovator’s Dilemma—the problem of an entrenched market leader falling to smaller, nimbler companies—drove him to reinvent his approach to corporate strategy.<br />• How Nvidia saw the coming AI wave sooner than anyone else, and how it bet its future on a technology that had not yet arrived.<br /><br />A rare view into Nvidia’s distinct culture and Jensen’s management principles, <em>The Nvidia Way</em> is a book for our moment as well as an instant classic of business history, with enduring lessons for entrepreneurs and managers alike.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In these nine stunningly original, provocative, and poignant stories, Ted Chiang tackles some of humanity’s oldest questions along with new quandaries only he could imagine.<br /><br />In "The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate," a portal through time forces a fabric seller in ancient Baghdad to grapple with past mistakes and second chances. In "Exhalation," an alien scientist makes a shocking discovery with ramifications that are literally universal. In "Anxiety Is the Dizziness of Freedom," the ability to glimpse into alternate universes necessitates a radically new examination of the concepts of choice and free will.<br /><br />Including stories being published for the first time as well as some of his rare and classic uncollected work, <i>Exhalation</i> is Ted Chiang at his best: profound, sympathetic—revelatory.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>
  <b>Our ability to pay attention is collapsing. From the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Chasing the Scream</i> and <i>Lost Connections</i> comes a groundbreaking examination of why this is happening—and how to get our attention back.</b>
</b><br /><br />Like so many of us, Johann Hari was finding it much harder to focus than he used to. He found that a life of constantly switching from device to device, from tab to tab, is diminishing and depressing. He tried all sorts of self-help solutions—even abandoning his phone for three months—but in the long-term, nothing seemed to work. So Hari went on an epic journey across the world to interview the leading experts on human attention and to study their scientific findings—and learned that everything we think we know about this crisis is wrong.<br /><br />In the U.S., teenagers now focus on a task for only sixty-five seconds on average, and office workers manage only three minutes. We think this inability to focus is a personal flaw, an individual failure to exert enough willpower over our devices. The truth is even more Our focus has been stolen by powerful external forces, and the science shows that these forces have been ramping up for decades—leaving us uniquely vulnerable, when social media arrived, to corporations determined to raid our attention for profit. These forces have been so successful that our collapse in attention is behind many of the wider problems society faces.<br /><br />In <i>Stolen Focus</i>, Hari embarks on a thrilling journey, taking readers from veterinarians who diagnose dogs with ADHD, to Silicon Valley dissidents who exposed social media companies' furtive attempts to hack our focus; from a favela in Rio where everyone lost their attention in a particularly catastrophic way, to an office in New Zealand that discovered a remarkable technique to restore their workers' attention.<br /><br />In this urgent, deeply researched book, Hari shows that if we understand the twelve true causes of this crisis—from the collapse of sustained reading to the disruption of boredom to rising pollution—we, as individuals and as a society, can finally begin to solve it by staging an attention rebellion. Finally, we have a way to get our focus back.<br />]]></book_description>

    <user_review><![CDATA[I really enjoyed this book, as I suffer from a difficulty of attention also. It is lately harder to deep work in 2 hour blocks, or even *gulp* read a book, when my phone and email can so easily distract me. And I am a person who greatly values deep learning and reading! So it was a relief to see a scientifically backed narrative that I am not alone, that this is a problem plaguing all of us. Because all it takes is a small interruption:<br /><br /><blockquote>"A study by Professor Michael Posner at the University of Oregon found that if you are focusing on something and you get interrupted, on average it will take twenty-three minutes for you to get back to the same state of focus."</blockquote><br /><br />I didn't expect this book to tie into what I'm trying to build at my new company - <a target="_blank" href="https://www.smashing.xyz" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.smashing.xyz</a> - but it really hit on it. Because a key cause of our inability to focus comes from the information overload that we are all living in. And Smashing is all about building a platform that curates for people to combat exactly that!<br /><br /><blockquote>"What they discovered is there is one mechanism that can make this happen every time. You just have to flood the system with more information. The more information you pump in, the less time people can focus on any individual piece of it."</blockquote><br /><br />And this isn't even our fault - we are living in a system incentivized to amp it up:<br /><br /><blockquote>"I realized this is one of the crucial reasons why life has accelerated every decade since the 1880s: we are living in an economic machine that requires greater speed to keep going—and that inevitably degrades our attention over time. In fact, when I reflected on it, this need for economic growth seemed to be the underlying force that was driving so many of the causes of poor attention that I had learned about—our increasing stress, our swelling work hours, our more invasive technologies, our lack of sleep, our bad diets."</blockquote><br /><br />I think my key takeaway though is encapsulated in this quote - we need to slow down and be deliberate and be ok with going at a speed we are comfortable with. This is hard to do this as it leaves us with a massive sense of we might be missing out on things. So we have to structure our lives to focus on what we want to focus on and limit the rest. <br /><br /><blockquote>"One of the leading experts on this topic is Guy Claxton, professor of learning sciences at the University of Winchester, who I went to interview in Sussex, in England. He has analyzed what happens to a person’s focus if they engage in deliberately slow practices, like yoga, or tai chi, or meditation, as discovered in a broad range of scientific studies, and he has shown they improve your ability to pay attention by a significant amount. I asked him why. He said that “we have to shrink the world to fit our cognitive bandwidth.” If you go too fast, you overload your abilities, and they degrade. But when you practice moving at a speed that is compatible with human nature—and you build that into your daily life—you begin to train your attention and focus. “That’s why those disciplines make you smarter. It’s not about humming or wearing orange robes.” Slowness, he explained, nurtures attention, and speed shatters it. "</blockquote><br /><br />I loved the description of the authors 3 month online purge, going to a beach town and just bringing books. It was interesting it took the author a few weeks to get into the groove - it takes a while. And fascinating that by the end of it the author valued going on hours long walks and just thinking. It's that thinking time where we process things in our life. And yet, I'm unable to even drive 10 min without turning on a podcast. That was great food for thought. <br /><br /><blockquote>"I noticed that if I spent a day where I experienced three hours of flow early on, for the rest of the day, I felt relaxed and open and able to engage—to walk along the beach, or start chatting to people, or read a book, without feeling cramped, or irritable, or phone-hungry. It was like the flow was relaxing my body and opening my mind—perhaps because I knew I had done my best."</blockquote><br /><br />In the end, I wholeheartedly agree with this: <br /><br /><blockquote>"I like the person I become when I read a lot of books. I dislike the person I become when I spend a lot of time on social media."</blockquote>]]></user_review>

    <book_description><![CDATA[One of the Financial TImes' Best Books of 2021<br /><br />A bestselling author, neuroscientist, and computer engineer unveils a theory of intelligence that will revolutionize our understanding of the brain and the future of AI. For all of neuroscience's advances, we've made little progress on its biggest How do simple cells in the brain create intelligence? Jeff Hawkins and his team discovered that the brain uses maplike structures to build a model of the world-not just one model, but hundreds of thousands of models of everything we know. This discovery allows Hawkins to answer important questions about how we perceive the world, why we have a sense of self, and the origin of high-level thought.

    <book_description><![CDATA[Originally published in 1968, Ursula K. Le Guin’s A Wizard of Earthsea marks the first of the six now beloved Earthsea titles. Ged was the greatest sorcerer in Earthsea, but in his youth he was the reckless Sparrowhawk. In his hunger for power and knowledge, he tampered with long-held secrets and loosed a terrible shadow upon the world. This is the tumultuous tale of his testing, how he mastered the mighty words of power, tamed an ancient dragon, and crossed death's threshold to restore the balance.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>Out of nowhere, like a cool breeze in a marketplace crowded with advice, comes Byron Katie and “The Work.” </b>In the midst of a normal life, Katie became increasingly depressed, and over a ten-year period sank further into rage, despair, and thoughts of suicide. Then one morning, she woke up in a state of absolute joy, filled with the realization of how her own suffering had ended. The freedom of that realization has never left her, and now in Loving What Is you can discover the same freedom through The Work. The Work is simply four questions that, when applied to a specific problem, enable you to see what is troubling you in an entirely different light. As Katie says, “It’s not the problem that causes our suffering; it’s our thinking about the problem.” Contrary to popular belief, trying to let go of a painful thought never works; instead, once we have done The Work, the thought lets go of us. At that point, we can truly love what is, just as it is. Loving What Is will show you step-by-step, through clear and vivid examples, exactly how to use this revolutionary process for yourself. You’ll see people do The Work with Katie on a broad range of human problems, from a wife ready to leave her husband because he wants more sex, to a Manhattan worker paralyzed by fear of terrorism, to a woman suffering over a death in her family. Many people have discovered The Work’s power to solve problems; in addition, they say that through The Work they experience a sense of lasting peace and find the clarity and energy to act, even in situations that had previously seemed impossible. If you continue to do The Work, you may discover, as many people have, that the questioning flows into every aspect of your life, effortlessly undoing the stressful thoughts that keep you from experiencing peace. Loving What Is offers everything you need to learn and live this remarkable process, and to find happiness as what Katie calls “a lover of reality.”]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>A gripping historical novel set in 11th century Persia that imagines the life of poet and philosopher Omar Khayyam</b>Accused of mocking the inviolate codes of Islam, the Persian poet and sage Omar Khayyam fortuitously finds sympathy with the very man who is to judge his alleged crimes. Recognising genius, the judge decides to spare him and gives him instead a small, blank book, encouraging him to confine his thoughts to it alone.Thus begins the seamless blend of fact and fiction that is Samarkand. Vividly re-creating the history of the manuscript of the Rubaiyaat of Omar Khayyam, Amin Maalouf spans continents and centuries with breathtaking the dusky exoticism of 11th-century Persia, with its poetesses and assassins; the same country's struggles nine hundred years later, seen through the eyes of an American academic obsessed with finding the original manuscript; and the fated maiden voyage of the Titanic, whose tragedy led to the Rubaiyaat's final resting place - all are brought to life with keen assurance by this gifted and award-winning writer.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<strong>From a leading child psychologist comes this groundbreaking new understanding of children's behavior, offering insight and strategies to support both parents and children.</strong><br /><br />Over her decades as a clinical psychologist, Dr. Mona Delahooke has routinely counseled distraught parents who struggle to manage their children's challenging, sometimes oppositional behaviors. These families are understandably focused on correcting or improving a child's lack of compliance, emotional outbursts, tantrums, and other "out of control" behavior. But, as she has shared with these families, a perspective shift is needed. Behavior, no matter how challenging, is not the problem but a symptom; a clue about what is happening in a child's unique physiologic makeup.<br /><br />In <em>Brain-Body Parenting</em>, Dr. Delahooke offers a radical new approach to parenting based on her clinical experience as well as the most recent research in neuroscience and child psychology. Instead of a "top-down" approach to behavior that focuses on the thinking brain, she calls for a "bottom-up" approach that considers the essential role of the entire nervous system, which produces children's feelings and behaviors.<br /><br />When we begin to understand the biology beneath the behavior, suggests Dr. Delahooke, we give our children the resources they need to grow and thrive--and we give ourselves the gift of a happier, more connected relationship with them. <em>Brain-Body Parenting</em> empowers parents with tools to help their children develop self-regulation skills while also encouraging parental self-care, which is crucial for parents to have the capacity to provide the essential "co-regulation" children need. When parents shift from trying to secure compliance to supporting connection and balance in the body and mind, they unlock a deeper understanding of their child, encouraging calmer behavior, more harmonious family dynamics, and increased resilience.<br /><br /><br />]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA["On my business card, I am a corporate president. In my mind, I am a game developer. But in my heart, I am a gamer." —Satoru Iwata<br /><br />Satoru Iwata was the former Global President and CEO of Nintendo and a gifted programmer who played a key role in the creation of many of the world’s best-known games. He led the production of innovative platforms such as the Nintendo DS and the Wii, and laid the groundwork for the development of the wildly successful Pokémon Go game and the Nintendo Switch. Known for his analytical and imaginative mind, but even more for his humility and people-first approach to leadership, Satoru Iwata was beloved by game fans and developers worldwide.<br /><br />In this motivational collection, Satoru Iwata addresses diverse subjects such as locating bottlenecks, how success breeds resistance to change, and why programmers should never say no. Drawn from the "Iwata Asks" series of interviews with key contributors to Nintendo games and hardware, and featuring conversations with renowned Mario franchise creator Shigeru Miyamoto and creator of EarthBound Shigesato Itoi, 'ASK IWATA' offers game fans and business leaders an insight into the leadership, development and design philosophies of one of the most beloved figures in gaming history.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>From the author of <i>Sapiens</i> comes the groundbreaking story of how information networks have made, and unmade, our world.</b><br /><br />For the last 100,000 years, we Sapiens have accumulated enormous power. But despite all our discoveries, inventions, and conquests, we now find ourselves in an existential crisis. The world is on the verge of ecological collapse. Misinformation abounds. And we are rushing headlong into the age of AI—a new information network that threatens to annihilate us. For all that we have accomplished, why are we so self-destructive?<br /><br /><i>Nexus</i> looks through the long lens of human history to consider how the flow of information has shaped us, and our world. Taking us from the Stone Age, through the canonization of the Bible, early modern witch-hunts, Stalinism, Nazism, and the resurgence of populism today, Yuval Noah Harari asks us to consider the complex relationship between information and truth, bureaucracy and mythology, wisdom and power. He explores how different societies and political systems throughout history have wielded information to achieve their goals, for good and ill. And he addresses the urgent choices we face as non-human intelligence threatens our very existence.<br /> <br />Information is not the raw material of truth; neither is it a mere weapon. <i>Nexus</i> explores the hopeful middle ground between these extremes, and in doing so, rediscovers our shared humanity.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>Acclaimed Washington Post reporter Taylor Lorenz presents a groundbreaking social history of the internet—revealing how online influence and the creators who amass it have reshaped our world, online and off.</b><br /><br />For over a decade, Taylor Lorenz has been the authority on internet culture, documenting its far-reaching effects on all corners of our lives. Her reporting is serious yet entertaining and illuminates deep truths about ourselves and the lives we create online. In her debut book, <i>Extremely Online</i>, she reveals how online influence came to upend the world, demolishing traditional barriers and creating whole new sectors of the economy. Lorenz shows this phenomenon to be one of the most disruptive changes in modern capitalism.<br /><br />By tracing how the internet has changed what we want and how we go about getting it, Lorenz unearths how social platforms’ power users radically altered our expectations of content, connection, purchasing, and power. Lorenz documents how moms who started blogging were among the first to monetize their personal brands online, how bored teens who began posting selfie videos reinvented fame as we know it, and how young creators on TikTok are leveraging opportunities to opt out of the traditional career pipeline. It’s the real social history of the internet.<br /><br />Emerging seemingly out of nowhere, these shifts in how we use the internet seem easy to dismiss as fads. However, these social and economic transformations have resulted in a digital dynamic so unappreciated and insurgent that it ultimately created new approaches to work, entertainment, fame, and ambition in the 21st century.<br /><br /><i>Extremely Online</i> is the inside, untold story of what we have done to the internet, and what it has done to us.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>From one of the world’s leading economists, a grand narrative of the century that made us richer than ever, yet left us unsatisfied  </b><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Before 1870, humanity lived in dire poverty, with a slow crawl of invention offset by a growing population. Then came a great shift: invention sprinted forward, doubling our technological capabilities each generation and utterly transforming the economy again and again. Our ancestors would have presumed we would have used such powers to build utopia. But it was not so. When 1870–2010 ended, the world instead saw global warming; economic depression, uncertainty, and inequality; and broad rejection of the status quo. <br /><br /><br /> <br /><br /><br />Economist Brad DeLong's <i>Slouching Towards Utopia</i> tells the story of how this unprecedented explosion of material wealth occurred, how it transformed the globe, and why it failed to deliver us to utopia. Of remarkable breadth and ambition, it reveals the last century to have been less a march of progress than a slouch in the right direction. ]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>From the New York Times bestselling author of <i>Chasing the Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs</i>, a startling challenge to our thinking about depression and anxiety.</b><br /><br />Award-winning journalist Johann Hari suffered from depression since he was a child and started taking antidepressants when he was a teenager. He was told—like his entire generation—that his problem was caused by a chemical imbalance in his brain. As an adult, trained in the social sciences, he began to investigate this question—and he learned that almost everything we have been told about depression and anxiety is wrong. <br /><br />Across the world, Hari discovered social scientists who were uncovering the real causes—and they are mostly not in our brains, but in the way we live today. Hari’s journey took him from the people living in the tunnels beneath Las Vegas, to an Amish community in Indiana, to an uprising in Berlin—all showing in vivid and dramatic detail these new insights. They lead to solutions radically different from the ones we have been offered up until now.<br /><br />Just as <i>Chasing the Scream</i> transformed the global debate about addiction, with over twenty million views for his TED talk and the animation based on it, <i>Lost Connections</i> will lead us to a very different debate about depression and anxiety—one that shows how, together, we can end this epidemic.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[What is a safe haven? What role should they play in an investment portfolio? Do we use them only to seek shelter until the passing of financial storms? Or are they something more? Contrary to everything we know from modern financial theory, can higher returns actually come as a result of lowering risk? In Safe Haven , hedge fund manager Mark Spitznagel—one of the top practitioners of safe haven investing and portfolio risk mitigation in the world—answers these questions and more. Investors who heed the message in this book will never look at risk mitigation the same way again.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In the perspective-altering tradition of Malcolm Gladwell’s The Tipping Point and Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s The Black Swan comes a provocative challenge to how we think our world works—and why small, chance events can divert our lives and change everything, by social scientist and Atlantic writer Brian Klaas.<br /><br />If you could rewind your life to the very beginning and then press play, would everything turn out the same? Or could making an accidental phone call or missing an exit off the highway change not just your life, but history itself? And would you remain blind to the radically different possible world you unknowingly left behind?<br /><br />In Fluke, myth-shattering social scientist Brian Klaas dives deeply into the phenomenon of random chance and the chaos it can sow, taking aim at most people’s neat and tidy storybook version of reality. The book’s argument is that we willfully ignore a bewildering but for a few small changes, our lives—and our societies—could be radically different.<br /><br />Offering an entirely new lens, Fluke explores how our world really works, driven by strange interactions and apparently random events. How did one couple’s vacation cause 100,000 people to die? Does our decision to hit the snooze button in the morning radically alter the trajectory of our lives? And has the evolution of humans been inevitable, or are we simply the product of a series of freak accidents?<br /><br />Drawing on social science, chaos theory, history, evolutionary biology, and philosophy, Klaas provides a brilliantly fresh look at why things happen—all while providing mind-bending lessons on how we can live smarter, be happier, and lead more fulfilling lives.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>From the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Boys in the Boat</i>, a gripping World War II saga of patriotism and courage: the special Japanese-American Army unit that overcame brutal odds in Europe; their families, incarcerated back home; and a young man who refused to surrender his constitutional rights, even if it meant imprisonment.</b><br /><br />They came from across the continent and Hawaii. Their parents taught them to embrace both their Japanese heritage and the ways of their American homeland. They faced bigotry, yet they believed in their bright futures as American citizens. But within days of Pearl Harbor, the FBI was ransacking their houses and locking up their fathers. And within months many would themselves be living behind barbed wire.<br /><br /><i>Facing the Mountain</i> is an unforgettable chronicle of war-time America and the battlefields of Europe. Based on Daniel James Brown's extensive interviews with the families of the protagonists as well as deep archival research, it portrays the kaleidoscopic journey of four Japanese-American families and their sons, who volunteered for 442nd Regimental Combat Team and were deployed to France, Germany, and Italy, where they were asked to do the near impossible.<br /><br />But this is more than a war story. Brown also tells the story of these soldiers' parents, immigrants who were forced to shutter the businesses, surrender their homes, and submit to life in concentration camps on U.S. soil. Woven throughout is the chronicle of a brave young man, one of a cadre of patriotic resisters who stood up against their government in defense of their own rights. Whether fighting on battlefields or in courtrooms, these were Americans under unprecedented strain, doing what Americans do best--striving, resisting, pushing back, rising up, standing on principle, laying down their lives, and enduring.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Brendan Doyle, a specialist in the work of the early-nineteenth century poet William Ashbless, reluctantly accepts an invitation from a millionaire to act as a guide to time-travelling tourists. But while attending a lecture given by Samuel Taylor Coleridge in 1810, he becomes marooned in Regency London, where dark and dangerous forces know about the gates in time.<br /><br />Caught up in the intrigue between rival bands of beggars, pursued by Egyptian sorcerers, and befriended by Coleridge, Doyle somehow survives and learns more about the mysterious Ashbless than he could ever have imagined possible...]]></book_description>

    <user_review><![CDATA[Feb 2025: just re-read this 17 years later. It's still fantastic! Amazing magical realism to bring in sorcery and time travel to 18th century London. I loved the William Ashbless character [spoilers removed]. <br /><br />2008 review: <br />I enjoyed every second of this book. I haven't read a time travel book in a long time, but loved this one, as the descriptions of London in 1812 were very rich. I loved how Lord Byron and other famous poets were running around, and the descriptions of all the beggars were fascinating. Add in some ancient Egyptian magic and you've got a great book!<br /><br />Random sidenote: It's interesting to think that back then poets were the rockstars of the age, as the only form of mass-media was newspapers, so those who mastered the written word could be broadcast much further than any musician or actor. How times have changed!]]></user_review>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Thrown in prison for a crime he has not committed, Edmond Dantes is confined to the grim fortress of If. There he learns of a great hoard of treasure hidden on the Isle of Monte Cristo and becomes determined not only to escape but to unearth the treasure and use it to plot the destruction of the three men responsible for his incarceration. A huge popular success when it was first serialized in the 1840s, Dumas was inspired by a real-life case of wrongful imprisonment when writing his epic tale of suffering and retribution.]]></book_description>

The artfulness of Monte Cristo's revenge is so slowly unveiled, after having been prepared by so many years by him, that it truly is impressive to read. <br /><br />Also fascinating that this novel originally appeared as a series of articles in the newspaper in France.

But it is also a story about happiness - does getting revenge on one's enemies make you happy or does it make you more miserable by pursuit of something dark? Do you need to have known suffering to know happiness or can you just be grateful for what you have? Personally, I don't think you need to know suffering first hand, but it is good to read books about it.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/notes/44539696-the-count-of-monte-cristo/1-otis-chandler/dbdb281e-3fca-4bc4-9474-0cd94cb1c47a?ref=rnlp" rel="nofollow noopener">"There is neither happiness nor misery in the world; there is only the comparison of one state with another, nothing more.

    <book_description><![CDATA[The news-breaking book that has sent shockwaves through the Bush White House, Ghost Wars is the most accurate and revealing account yet of the CIA's secret involvement in al-Qaeda's evolution. It won the Pulitzer Prize in 2005.Prize-winning journalist Steve Coll has spent years reporting from the Middle East, accessed previously classified government files and interviewed senior US officials and foreign spymasters. Here he gives the full inside story of the CIA's covert funding of an Islamic jihad against Soviet forces in Afghanistan, explores how this sowed the seeds of Bin Laden's rise, traces how he built his global network and brings to life the dramatic battles within the US government over national security. Above all, he lays bare American intelligence's continual failure to grasp the rising threat of terrorism in the years leading to 9/11 - and its devastating consequences.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[An urgent warning of the unprecedented risks that a wave of fast-developing technologies poses to global order, and how we might contain them while we have the chance—from a cofounder of the pioneering artificial intelligence company DeepMind<br /><br />“A fascinating, well-written, and important book.”—Yuval Noah Harari<br />“Essential reading.”—Daniel Kahneman<br />“An excellent guide for navigating unprecedented times.”—Bill Gates<br /><br />We are about to cross a critical threshold in the history of our species. Everything is about to change. Soon we will live surrounded by AIs. They will carry out complex tasks—operating businesses, producing unlimited digital content, running core government services and maintaining infrastructure. This will be a world of DNA printers and quantum computers, engineered pathogens and autonomous weapons, robot assistants and abundant energy. It represents nothing less than a step change in human capability.  <br /> <br />We are not prepared. <br /> <br />Mustafa Suleyman has been at the center of this revolution, one poised to become the single greatest accelerant of progress in history. The coming decade, he argues, will be defined by this wave of powerful, fast-proliferating new technologies. Driven by overwhelming strategic and commercial incentives, these tools will help address our global challenges and create vast wealth—but also upheaval on a once unimaginable scale. <br /> <br />In The Coming Wave , Suleyman shows how these forces threaten the grand bargain of the nation state, the foundation of global order. As our fragile governments sleepwalk into disaster, we face an existential unprecedented harms arising from unchecked openness on one side, the threat of overbearing surveillance on the other. Can we forge a narrow path between catastrophe and dystopia? <br /> <br />In this groundbreaking book from the ultimate AI insider, Suleyman establishes “the containment problem”—the task of maintaining control over powerful technologies—as the essential challenge of our age.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>The dramatic rise, disappearance, and near-fall of Aimee Semple McPherson, America’s most famous woman evangelist. <br /><br /></b>On a spring day in 1926, Aimee Semple McPherson wandered into the Pacific Ocean and vanished. Weeks later she reappeared in the desert, claiming to have been kidnapped. A national media frenzy and months of investigation ensued. Who was this woman? <br /><br />America’s most famous evangelist, McPherson was a sophisticated marketer who used spectacle, storytelling, and the newest technology—including her own radio station—to bring God’s message to the masses. Her innovations brought Pentecostalism into the mainstream, paved the way for televangelists, and shaped the future of American Christianity. Her Angelus Temple in Echo Park, Los Angeles, can be called the first megachurch. Her Foursquare Church continues, with more than eight million faithful around the world. <br /><br />But after her disappearance, as crowds gathered at the water’s edge, people Was McPherson everybody’s saintly sister, or a con-artist sinner? The story of what happened next—sex scandals, religious persecution, legal shenanigans, the seemingly unshakable faith of thousands of followers, and the race to cover it all—runs through the center of Claire Hoffman’s thrilling <i>Sister, Sinner</i>. <br /><br />A riveting journey into the rise of popular religion in America and life in early Hollywood, and told with the flavor of the period's noir mysteries, this is an unforgettable story of an iconic woman, largely overlooked, who changed the world.]]></book_description>

They have strokes of unparalleled genius, alienate friends and lovers, descend into isolation and insanity. Some of their discoveries reshape human life for the better; others pave the way to chaos and unimaginable suffering. The lines are never clear.<br /><br />At a breakneck pace and with a wealth of disturbing detail, Labatut uses the imaginative resources of fiction to tell the stories of the scientists and mathematicians who expanded our notions of the possible.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>From the author of the New York Times #1 bestseller The Untethered Soul comes this thought-provoking, inspirational memoir on the magic that happens when you just let go</b><br /><br />Spirituality is meant to bring about harmony and peace. But the diversity of our philosophies, beliefs, concepts, and views about the soul often leads to confusion. To reconcile the noise that clouds spirituality, Michael Singer combines accounts of his own life journey to enlightenment—from his years as a hippie-loner to his success as a computer program engineer to his work in spiritual and humanitarian efforts—with lessons on how to put aside conflicting beliefs, let go of worries, and transform misdirected desires. Singer provides a road map to a new way of living not in the moment, but to exist in a state of perpetual happiness.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[One of the most acclaimed books of our time, winner of both the Pulitzer and the Francis Parkman prizes, <b>The Power Broker</b> tells the hidden story behind the shaping (and mis-shaping) of twentieth-century New York (city and state) and makes public what few have known: that Robert Moses was, for almost half a century, the single most powerful man of our time in New York, the shaper not only of the city's politics but of its physical structure and the problems of urban decline that plague us today.<br /><br />In revealing how Moses did it--how he developed his public authorities into a political machine that was virtually a fourth branch of government, one that could bring to their knees Governors and Mayors (from La Guardia to Lindsay) by mobilizing banks, contractors, labor unions, insurance firms, even the press and the Church, into an irresistible economic force--Robert Caro reveals how power works in all the cities of the United States. Moses built an empire and lived like an emperor. He personally conceived and completed public works costing 27 billion dollars--the greatest builder America (and probably the world) has ever known. Without ever having been elected to office, he dominated the men who were--even his most bitter enemy, Franklin D. Roosevelt, could not control him--until he finally encountered, in Nelson Rockefeller, the only man whose power (and ruthlessness in wielding it) equalled his own.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[He is a man of many names. Some call him the Golden One; others, the Lord of the Silver Bow. To the Dardanians, he is Prince Aeneas. But to his friends, he is <b>Helikaon</b>. Strong, fast, quick of mind, he is a bold warrior, hated by his enemies, feared even by his Trojan allies. For there is a darkness at the heart of the Golden One, a savagery that, once awakened, can be appeased only with blood.<br /><br /><b>Argurios</b> the Mykene is a peerless fighter, a man of unbending principles and unbreakable will. Like all of the Mykene warriors, he lives to conquer and to kill. Dispatched by King Agamemnon to scout the defenses of the golden city of Troy, he is Helikaon's sworn enemy.<br /><br /><b>Andromache</b> is a priestess of Thera betrothed against her will to Hektor, prince of Troy. Scornful of tradition, skilled in the arts of war, and passionate in the ways of her order, Andromache vows to love whom she pleases and to live as she desires.<br /><br />Now fate is about to thrust these three together; and, from the sparks of passionate love and hate, ignite a fire that will engulf the world.<br /><br />Readers who know the works of David Gemmell expect nothing less than excellence from this author, whose taut prose, driving plots, and full-bodied characters have won him legions of fans the world over. Now, with this first masterly volume in an epic reimagining of the Trojan War, Gemmell has written an ageless drama of brave deeds and fierce battles, of honor and treachery, of love won and lost.<br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[After Englishman John Blackthorne is lost at sea, he awakens in a place few Europeans know of and even fewer have seen--Nippon. Thrust into the closed society that is seventeenth-century Japan, a land where the line between life and death is razor-thin, Blackthorne must negotiate not only a foreign people, with unknown customs and language, but also his own definitions of morality, truth, and freedom. As internal political strife and a clash of cultures lead to seemingly inevitable conflict, Blackthorne's loyalty and strength of character are tested by both passion and loss, and he is torn between two worlds that will each be forever changed.<br /><br />Powerful and engrossing, capturing both the rich pageantry and stark realities of life in feudal Japan, <i>Sh</i><i>ō</i><i>gun</i> is a critically acclaimed powerhouse of a book. Heart-stopping, edge-of-your-seat action melds seamlessly with intricate historical detail and raw human emotion. Endlessly compelling, this sweeping saga captivated the world to become not only one of the best-selling novels of all time but also one of the highest-rated television miniseries, as well as inspiring a nationwide surge of interest in the culture of Japan. Shakespearean in both scope and depth, <i>Sh</i><i>ō</i><i>gun</i> is, as the <i>New York Times</i> put it, "...not only something you read--you live it." Provocative, absorbing, and endlessly fascinating, there is only one: <i>Sh</i><i>ō</i><i>gun.</i>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In 1935, with a doctorate in art history and no prospect of a job, the 26-year-old Ernst Gombrich was invited by a publishing acquaintance to attempt a history of the world for younger readers. Amazingly, he completed the task in an intense six weeks, and <i>Eine kurze Weltgeschichte für junge Leser</i> was published in Vienna to immediate success, and is now available in seventeen languages across the world. Toward the end of his long life, Gombrich embarked upon a revision and, at last, an English translation. <i>A Little History of the World</i> presents his lively and involving history to English-language readers for the first time. Superbly designed and freshly illustrated, this is a book to be savored and collected. In forty concise chapters, Gombrich tells the story of man from the stone age to the atomic bomb. In between emerges a colorful picture of wars and conquests, grand works of art, and the spread and limitations of science. This is a text dominated not by dates and facts, but by the sweep of mankind's experience across the centuries, a guide to humanity's achievements and an acute witness to its frailties. The product of a generous and humane sensibility, this timeless account makes intelligible the full span of human history.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[By his early thirties, Paul Allen was a world-famous billionaire-and that was just the beginning.<br /><br />In 2007 and 2008, Time named Paul Allen, the cofounder of Microsoft, one of the hundred most influential people in the world. Since he made his fortune, his impact has been felt in science, technology, business, medicine, sports, music, and philanthropy. His passion, curiosity, and intellectual rigor-combined with the resources to launch and support new initiatives-have literally changed the world.<br /><br />In 2009 Allen discovered that he had lymphoma, lending urgency to his desire to share his story for the first time. In this long-awaited memoir, Allen explains how he has solved problems, what he's learned from his many endeavors-both the triumphs and the failures-and his compelling vision for the future. He reflects candidly on an extraordinary life.<br /><br />The book also features previously untold stories about everything from the true origins of Microsoft to Allen's role in the dawn of private space travel (with SpaceShipOne) and in discoveries at the frontiers of brain science. With honesty, humor, and insight, Allen tells the story of a life of ideas made real.]]></book_description>

    <user_review><![CDATA[Great story about the founding of Microsoft from it's cofounder Paul Allen. I've read a few books about Microsofts history before (such as <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41643.Gates" rel="nofollow noopener">Gates</a>), but it was fascinating to hear it from the horses mouth. <br /><br />What stuck out for me was that Paul and Bill were on the cutting edge of software ever since they first saw a computer as teenagers. Malcolm Gladwell in <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3228917-outliers" rel="nofollow noopener">Outliers</a> mentioned the fact that having access to a computer at that time was a huge advantage, and Paul's story confirms that. The world only changes massively so many times, and the age of computing has certainly been one of them - and Paul and Bill were in the right place, at the right time, and with the right drive to succeed.<br /><br />What was impressive was how Paul and Bill executed like crazy. They had the edge, and they worked really hard, long hours to keep it. It was sad that Paul burned out so early - but also understandable given that Bill had such a strong personality.<br /><br />Paul prides himself on being a forward thinker. He gives multiple stories of always following the latest technology and trying to look forward and think about what is coming next. Indeed, it's that trait that led to Microsoft being formed as they were certainly at the forefront of the software revolution. In one part of the book Paul even predicts that <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/show/366336" rel="nofollow noopener">Mobile is the next big platform and that the PC is dying</a>.<br /><br />I've always worked at startups, which tend to innovate more than they follow. So it was interesting to hear Allen talking about how Microsoft's strategy went from being on the cutting edge of technology in it's infancy to being a 400 pound gorilla that used a approach of copying innovative products and using it's cash reserves and muscle to out-execute on an idea. I suppose this is what a big company has to do - but it's a hard position to win from. An Microsoft really hasn't had a lot of wins lately. They haven't innovated enough on Hotmail. Bing is nice but not better than Google in any significant ways. And even the high and mighty Internet Explorer is really losing ground to Chrome/Firefox/Safari. Paul is right - you have to <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/show/366328" rel="nofollow noopener">look to what is ahead</a>.<br /><br />Since Microsoft, Paul has certainly stayed busy: owning sports teams, investing in lots of different companies, building a space program, and touring around on his 400 foot yacht. Most of his investments have been in the vein of improving technology and trying to predict the next big things, especially in his particular interests. <br /><br />I think his brain mapping project and the Digital Aristotle projects stand out - they sound really interesting and important. The appendix lists a few of the current challenges issues with getting a computer to understand human language, which was fascinating. Allen even alludes to the oft-mentioned Singularity, but says that he doesn't think it will occur in our lifetimes, as despite Moore's law advancing computing power fast enough, we are lightyears away with AI.<br /><br />Some useful tidbits:<br />- p65 Even Bill Gates wasn't the best at Math in college at Harvard. There are all kinds of smarts!<br />- Lesson: decentralize or don't distract the ceo: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/show/366326" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/show/...</a><br />- It was interesting that Allen said that his biggest mistakes were not finding the right people to help him execute his visions. It's all about people.<br /><br />Update: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/interviews/show/586.Paul_G_Allen" rel="nofollow noopener">my interview with Paul Allen</a> is now live!<br />]]></user_review>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • A groundbreaking manifesto on living better and longer that challenges the conventional medical thinking on aging and reveals a new approach to preventing chronic disease and extending long-term health, from a visionary physician and leading longevity expert</b><br /> <br />Wouldn’t you like to live longer? And better? In this operating manual for longevity, Dr. Peter Attia draws on the latest science to deliver innovative nutritional interventions, techniques for optimizing exercise and sleep, and tools for addressing emotional and mental health.<br /> <br />For all its successes, mainstream medicine has failed to make much progress against the diseases of aging that kill most people: heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and type 2 diabetes. Too often, it intervenes with treatments too late to help, prolonging lifespan at the expense of healthspan, or quality of life. Dr. Attia believes we must replace this outdated framework with a personalized, proactive strategy for longevity, one where we take action now, rather than waiting.<br /> <br />This is not “biohacking,” it’s science: a well-founded strategic and tactical approach to extending lifespan while also improving our physical, cognitive, and emotional health. Dr. Attia’s aim is less to tell you what to do and more to help you learn how to think about long-term health, in order to create the best plan for you as an individual. In Outlive, readers will discover:<br /> <br />• Why the cholesterol test at your annual physical doesn’t tell you enough about your actual risk of dying from a heart attack.<br />• That you may already suffer from an extremely common yet underdiagnosed liver condition that could be a precursor to the chronic diseases of aging.<br />• Why exercise is the most potent pro-longevity “drug”—and how to begin training for the “Centenarian Decathlon.”<br />• Why you should forget about diets, and focus instead on nutritional biochemistry, using technology and data to personalize your eating pattern.<br />• Why striving for physical health and longevity, but ignoring emotional health, could be the ultimate curse of all.<br /> <br />Aging and longevity are far more malleable than we think; our fate is not set in stone. With the right roadmap, you can plot a different path for your life, one that lets you outlive your genes to make each decade better than the one before.]]></book_description>

    <user_review><![CDATA[Best book I've read on this topic. Really changes your thinking on all sorts of health topics. I've followed Peter Attia's podcast for a while, but this is an excellent summary of all his best knowledge on health. He gave me a new goal and word - healthspan! Forget living a long time, the goal is to have a healthy body for as long as possible. <br /><br />But the biggest takeaway from the book is exercise is the biggest lever on healthspan. I would have thought diet and exercise were close, but no, exercise is orders of magnitude the biggest lever. And this applies to reducing risk from all the "4 horseman" as he calls them (cancer, metabolic syndrome, alzheimers and brain degenerative diseases, and cardiovascular disease). <br /><br />"Study after study has found that regular exercisers live as much as a decade longer than sedentary people. Not only do habitual runners and cyclists tend to live longer, but they stay in better health, with less morbidity from causes related to metabolic dysfunction."<br /><br />One benefit of exercise is that it boosts your metabolism, which basically makes your body run healthier and be better at repairing itself. Interestingly, on the subject of taking supplements, Dr Attia was mostly negative on that with one exception, that he had a whole chapter about: rapamycin. I want to learn more about this drug. <br /><br />"By cleansing our cells of damaged proteins and other cellular junk, autophagy allows cells to run more cleanly and efficiently and helps make them more resistant to stress. But as we get older, autophagy declines. Impaired autophagy is thought to be an important driver of numerous aging-related phenotypes and ailments, such as neurodegeneration and osteoarthritis. Thus, I find it fascinating that this very important cellular mechanism can be triggered by certain kinds of interventions, such as a temporary reduction in nutrients (as when we are exercising or fasting)—and the drug rapamycin."<br /><br />Strength is also super important, as muscle mass and bone density decay significantly after age 50, and it's very hard if not impossible to gain back later. Dr Attia recommends that whatever age you are (20s to 80s) it's best to build strength. His goal for his patients is to be in the top 5th percentile of strength for their age. Strength is another top predictor of healthspan - in a way it even defines it as if you are strong you can still hike/bike/surf/etc, and if you can't do the things you love you will lose your zest for life. <br /><br />"One of the prime hallmarks of aging is that our physical capacity erodes. Our cardiorespiratory fitness declines for various reasons that begin with lower cardiac output, primarily due to reduced maximum heart rate. We lose strength and muscle mass with each passing decade, our bones grow fragile and our joints stiffen, and our balance falters, a fact that many men and women discover the hard way, by falling off a ladder or while stepping off a curb."<br /><br />To improve strength, Dr Attia does and recommends consistent weight training, with a lot of focus on stability, as the most important thing is to be strong in a way that avoids injury as we do other things. He also does things like rucking, which sounds interesting and I may have to get into - the thesis here is our ancestors did a lot of carrying of heavy things, and it's really good for us therefore, but we don't do it as much anymore. Goal: be able to carry half your body weight in each hand for 1 minute. <br /><br />In my half-ironman training in the past few years I've done a lot of zone 2 bike rides, and I continue to do them. But I didn't realize they were actually really good for you outside of building base cycling form. Dr Attia does multiple zone 2 workouts per week. I love this, because it gives me permission to just go a long slow bike ride and know that is improving my fitness across the board. And of course, I use those to listen to audio books and podcasts - win/win!<br /><br />"As fundamental as zone 2 training is for professional cyclists, however, San Millán believes that it’s even more important for nonathletes, for two reasons. First, it builds a base of endurance for anything else you do in life, whether that is riding your bike in a one-hundred-mile century ride or playing with your kids or grandkids. The other reason is that he believes it plays a crucial role in preventing chronic disease by improving the health and efficiency of your mitochondria"<br /><br />The biggest correlated predictor of longevity number that we have is VO2 max. Dr Attia says his goal is to get to the top 2 percentile of VO2 max for his age. I love this, and this is my new goal in life. My Garmin watch says I'm 90th percentile, so I have more to climb!<br /><br />"It turns out that peak aerobic cardiorespiratory fitness, measured in terms of VO2 max, is perhaps the single most powerful marker for longevity."<br /><br />Good tip: "Where HIIT intervals are very short, typically measured in seconds, VO2 max intervals are a bit longer, ranging from three to eight minutes—and a notch less intense." <br />And: "The tried-and-true formula for these intervals is to go four minutes at the maximum pace you can sustain for this amount of time—not an all-out sprint, but still a very hard effort. Then ride or jog four minutes easy, which should be enough time for your heart rate to come back down to below about one hundred beats per minute. Repeat this four to six times and cool down."<br /><br />Alcohol is one of my weaknesses as I love a nice bottle of wine with a nice dinner. And I've listened to podcasts on the topic and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3773271457" rel="nofollow noopener">read a book about it: Drink</a>. My French teacher (and most French in general) swear that a small amount of wine is good for you, but the science is clear - alcohol is a net negative even in small amounts. But small amounts is much better for you than large amounts, and so if you are going to drink, Dr Attia recommends: <br /><br />"I strongly urge my patients to limit alcohol to fewer than seven servings per week, and ideally no more than two on any given day, and I manage to do a pretty good job adhering to this rule myself."<br /><br />Dr Attia highly recommends trying a GCM, which I haven't done yet but am very interested in. <br /><br />One thing I didn't know is you can't overeat protein - if you do so your body just excretes it. However if you overeat carbs or fats your body has to store those, and this is the major cause of weight gain. His chapter on how to measure your blood results and eat healthier was nothing new but a good overview. <br /><br />"Putting all these changes into practice typically means eating more olive oil and avocados and nuts, cutting back on (but not necessarily eliminating) things like butter and lard, and reducing the omega-6-rich corn, soybean, and sunflower oils—while also looking for ways to increase high-omega-3 marine PUFAs from sources such as salmon and anchovies."<br /><br />I have been a fan of occasionally doing 8/16 fasting as a tool for losing weight or if I just had a big late dinner the night before. But as a regular tool, despite the popularity of fasting in the last few years, Dr Attia is not a big fan, as it causes too much muscular decay. I still think its a useful occasional tool, but not a regular habit to adopt. <br /><br />"As a result of this and other research, I have become convinced that frequent, prolonged fasting may be neither necessary nor wise for most patients. The cost, in terms of lost lean mass (muscle) and reduced activity levels, simply does not justify whatever benefits it may bring. My rule of thumb for any eating pattern, in fact, is that you must eat enough to maintain lean mass (muscle) and long-term activity patterns."<br /><br />Dr Attia's last chapter was on mental health, where he was quite vulnerable and shared his own issues with abuse and depression, which led to a lot of anger. I think a lot of successful people are driven by trying to prove something in this way. Was a really good reminder that we all are probably not spending enough time paying attention to our mental health - it's as important as exercising, eating well, and sleeping well. So those are the big 4!<br /><br />Overall, great overview and one I may be re-reading parts of it. I was already applying a lot of this, some of it I was aware of but not applying so great reminder. And I learned some new things too. <br /> But mostly and overall, it's a strong case for living healthy now. If we are healthy now, we can find all kinds of things in the future to look forward to doing.<br /><br />"“I think people get old when they stop thinking about the future,” Ric told me. “If you want to find someone’s true age, listen to them. If they talk about the past and they talk about all the things that happened that they did, they’ve gotten old. If they think about their dreams, their aspirations, what they’re still looking forward to—they’re young.” Here’s to staying young, even as we grow older."<br />]]></user_review>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>From the legendary music producer, a master at helping people connect with the wellsprings of their creativity, comes a beautifully crafted book many years in the making that offers that same deep wisdom to all of us. </b><br /><br />"A gorgeous and inspiring work of art on creation, creativity, the work of the artist. It will gladden the hearts of writers and artists everywhere, and get them working again with a new sense of meaning and direction. A stunning accomplishment." --Anne Lamott<br /><br />"<i>I set out to write a book about what to do to make a great work of art. Instead, it revealed itself to be a book on how to be." --Rick Rubin</i><br /><br />Many famed music producers are known for a particular sound that has its day. Rick Rubin is known for something else: creating a space where artists of all different genres and traditions can home in on who they really are and what they really offer. He has made a practice of helping people transcend their self-imposed expectations in order to reconnect with a state of innocence from which the surprising becomes inevitable. Over the years, as he has thought deeply about where creativity comes from and where it doesn't, he has learned that being an artist isn't about your specific output, it's about your relationship to the world. Creativity has a place in everyone's life, and everyone can make that place larger. In fact, there are few more important responsibilities.<br /><br /><i>The Creative Act</i> is a beautiful and generous course of study that illuminates the path of the artist as a road we all can follow. It distills the wisdom gleaned from a lifetime's work into a luminous reading experience that puts the power to create moments--and lifetimes--of exhilaration and transcendence within closer reach for all of us.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The first installment in Neal Stephenson’s Light cycle, <i>Polostan</i> follows the early life of the enigmatic Dawn Rae Bjornberg. Born in the American West to a clan of cowboy anarchists, Dawn is raised in Leningrad after the Russian Revolution by her Russian father, a party line Leninist who re-christens her Aurora. She spends her early years in Russia but then grows up as a teenager in Montana, before being drawn into gunrunning and revolution in the streets of Washington, D.C., during the depths of the Great Depression. When a surprising revelation about her past puts her in the crosshairs of U.S. authorities, Dawn returns to Russia, where she is groomed as a spy by the organization that later becomes the KGB.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The portrayal of Stephen Dedalus's Dublin childhood and youth, his quest for identity through art and his gradual emancipation from the claims of family, religion and Ireland itself, is also an oblique self-portrait of the young James Joyce and a universal testament to the artist's 'eternal imagination'. Both an insight into Joyce's life and childhood, and a unique work of modernist fiction, <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i> is a novel of sexual awakening, religious rebellion and the essential search for voice and meaning that every nascent artist must face in order to blossom fully into themselves.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>
  <b>Inventing The Power Brokers Who Created the Dream of Los Angeles</b>
</i> traces the improbable rise of Los Angeles through the prism of six visionaries who had outsize influence on the city’s Phineas Banning, Harrison Gray Otis, Henry Huntington, Harry Chandler, William Mulholland, and Moses Sherman.<br /><br /><br /><br />In the late 1870s, Los Angeles was a violent, dusty, 29-square-mile pueblo with a few thousand souls, largely unchanged since its founding in 1781. By 1930, its size had swelled to within 96% of its current 468 square miles, housing a staggering 1.2 million people. In just 50 years, L.A. had joined the ranks of other world-class cities.<br /><br /><br /><br />In the tradition of Mike Davis’s classic work <i>City of Quartz</i>, Paul Haddad (<i>Freewaytopia</i> and <i>10,000 Steps a Day in L.A.</i>) debunks many myths about the City of Angels with a wildly entertaining narrative that sheds new light on the fascinating birth of modern Los Angeles. Power came from a select few, whose triumphs, scandals, and correspondence are well documented in <i>Inventing Paradise</i>, along with other little-known facts about L.A. history, <br /><br /><br /><br />How <i>Los Angeles Times</i> chief Harry Chandler pushed eugenics and endorsed “white spots”<br />Henry Huntington’s and Moses Sherman’s trolley systems and the extortion-type practices that led to their expansion<br />When Los Angeles was so desperate for water, it hired a miracle worker who promised rain<br />How L.A.’s power elite peddled the lie that the Owens River used to flow into Los Angeles and rightfully belonged to the city<br />When Los Angeles annexed a city in which monkeys cast votes<br />How Venice, California, was not the first Venice, California<br />William Mulholland’s game-changing construction of the Los Angeles Aqueduct, which raised the city’s population ceiling from 250,000 to 2.5 million<br /><br /><br /><br />Haddad also covers the heavy costs that came with creating paradise in such a short period of time, including car dependency, environmental problems, and deep-seated inequities between wealthy white Angelenos and people of color due to racist policies. All have left an imprint on present-day Los Angeles.<br /><br /><br /><br />Los Angeles is known as a city that should not exist—and yet it does. Through <i>Inventing Paradise</i>, Haddad shows readers that Los Angeles is not a paradise found, but a paradise that was willed into existence, owing to the collective vision of these six Gilded Era-born tycoons.<br /><br /><br />]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>"What every founder needs to know about marketing - read this before you hire a Head of Growth."<br />- Sean Ellis, Author, Hacking Growth</b><br /><br />Great startups don't waste time on small stuff. If you study the early days of any great startup, you’ll see that 90% of their growth came from 10% of the stuff they tried. But most needed years of experimentation to find their growth levers. This book aims to shortcut that process.<br /><br />Generic tactics like paid ads, SEO and referral programs will only get you so far. Growth levers are things like the professional photographs that made tens of thousands of customers trust AirBnb when they otherwise wouldn’t—a crucial move that unlocked explosive growth. They are unique to each startup; they’re seldom obvious. They come from specific unexpected customer insights, and cut across organizational functions.<br /><br />In this book you’ll get a process to find your big growth <br /><br />Map your growth model to find points of leverage where you can focus for the greatest impactUncover your customers' unconscious biases and triggersFind your prospects at their moment of highest needDiscover the exact words to explain your value clearly to customersRun experiments and use data to find the most impactful workRun growth sprints to push the pace and quality of learning and executionShift the team from perfectionism to a scrappy bold mindset<b>Matt Lerner</b> and his team have helped over 200 startups find their big growth levers as the founder of SYSTM. Previously, he was on the early growth team at PayPal, a partner at a Silicon Valley VC fund, and a past guest lecturer at Stanford Business School.<br /><br />This book shares the framework that Matt and his team have used to help over 200 seed-stage startups grow as much as 100X. It’s packed with examples and clear, step-by-step instructions.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<strong>"This book is for any parent who has ever struggled under the substantial weight of caregiving--which is to say, all of us. </strong><strong>
  <em>Good Inside</em>
</strong><strong> is not only a wise and practical guide to raising resilient, emotionally healthy kids, it's also a supportive resource for overwhelmed parents who need more compassion and less stress. Dr. Becky is the smart, thoughtful, in-the-trenches parenting expert we've been waiting for!"--Eve Rodsky, </strong><strong>
  <em>New York Times</em>
</strong><strong> bestselling author of </strong><strong>
  <em>Fair Play</em>
</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>
  <em>Find Your Unicorn Space</em>
</strong><br /><br /><strong>Dr. Becky Kennedy, wildly popular parenting expert and creator of @drbeckyatgoodinside, shares her groundbreaking approach to raising kids and offers practical strategies for parenting in a way that feels <em>good</em>.</strong><br /><br />Over the past several years, Dr. Becky Kennedy--known to her followers as "Dr. Becky"--has been sparking a parenting revolution. Millions of parents, tired of following advice that either doesn't work or simply doesn't feel good, have embraced Dr. Becky's empowering and effective approach, a model that prioritizes connecting with our kids over correcting them.<br /><br />Parents have long been sold a model of childrearing that simply doesn't work. From reward charts to time outs, many popular parenting approaches are based on shaping behavior, not raising humans. These techniques don't build the skills kids need for life, or account for their complex emotional needs. Add to that parents' complicated relationships with their own upbringings, and it's easy to see why so many caretakers feel lost, burned out, and worried they're failing their kids. In <em>Good Inside, </em> Dr. Becky shares her parenting philosophy, complete with actionable strategies, that will help parents move from uncertainty and self-blame to confidence and sturdy leadership.<br /><br />Offering perspective-shifting parenting principles and troubleshooting for specific scenarios--including sibling rivalry, separation anxiety, tantrums, and more--<em>Good Inside </em>is a comprehensive resource for a generation of parents looking for a new way to raise their kids while still setting them up for a lifetime of self-regulation, confidence, and resilience.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[How children think is one of the most enduring mysteries--and difficulties--of parenthood. The marketplace is full of gadgets and tools that claim to make your child smarter, happier, or learn languages faster, all built on the premise that manufacturers know something about your child's brain that you don't. These products are easy to sell, because good information about how children's minds really work is hard to come by.In their new book, neuroscientists Sandra Aamodt and Sam Wang separate fact from fiction about the inner workings of young minds. Martialing results from new studies and classic research, Aamodt and Wang provide the most complete answers out there on this subject. It liberates readers from superstitions and speculation, such as Freud's idea that all relationships are modeled on one's mother, or that it's not safe to eat sushi while pregnant. And it will reveal new truths about everything from how to make your baby sleep, to why we love to snuggle, to how children learn, forget, play, talk, walk, and feel.Welcome to Your Child's Brain is eye-opening and necessary, soon to become a staple for parents and children alike.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[For readers of Laura Hillenbrand's <i>Seabiscuit</i> and <i>Unbroken</i>, the dramatic story of the American rowing team that stunned the world at Hitler's 1936 Berlin Olympics.<p>Daniel James Brown's robust book tells the story of the University of Washington's 1936 eight-oar crew and their epic quest for an Olympic gold medal, a team that transformed the sport and grabbed the attention of millions of Americans. The sons of loggers, shipyard workers, and farmers, the boys defeated elite rivals first from eastern and British universities and finally the German crew rowing for Adolf Hitler in the Olympic games in Berlin, 1936.</p><p>The emotional heart of the story lies with one rower, Joe Rantz, a teenager without family or prospects, who rows not for glory, but to regain his shattered self-regard and to find a place he can call home. The crew is assembled by an enigmatic coach and mentored by a visionary, eccentric British boat builder, but it is their trust in each other that makes them a victorious team. They remind the country of what can be done when everyone quite literally pulls together—a perfect melding of commitment, determination, and optimism.</p><p>Drawing on the boys' own diaries and journals, their photos and memories of a once-in-a-lifetime shared dream, <i>The Boys in the Boat</i> is an irresistible story about beating the odds and finding hope in the most desperate of times—the improbable, intimate story of nine working-class boys from the American west who, in the depths of the Great Depression, showed the world what true grit really meant. It will appeal to readers of Erik Larson, Timothy Egan, James Bradley, and David Halberstam's <i>The Amateurs</i>.</p>]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Can what you eat determine how long, and how well, you live? The clinically proven answer is yes, and <i>The Longevity Diet</i> is easier to follow than you'd think. The culmination of 25 years of research on aging, nutrition, and disease across the globe, this unique program lays out a simple solution to living to a healthy old age through nutrition. The key is combining the healthy everyday eating plan the book outlines, with the scientifically engineered fasting-mimicking diet, or FMD; the FMD, done just 3-4 times a year, does away with the misery and starvation most of us experience while fasting, allowing you to reap all the beneficial health effects of a restrictive diet, while avoiding negative stressors, like low energy and sleeplessness. <br /><br />Valter Longo, director of the Longevity Institute at USC and the Program on Longevity and Cancer at IFOM in Milan, designed the FMD after making a series of remarkable discoveries in mice, then in humans, indicating that specific diets can activate stem cells and promote regeneration and rejuvenation in multiple organs to significantly reduce risk for diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer’s, and heart disease.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<b>THE INSTANT #1 <i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BESTSELLER * <i>New York Times Book Review</i> Editors' Choice<br /><br />From <i>New York Times </i>bestselling coauthor of The Coddling of the American Mind, an essential investigation into the collapse of youth mental health—and a plan for a healthier, freer childhood.<br /><br />“Erudite, engaging, combative, crusading.” —<i>New York Times Book Review</i><br /><br />“Words that chill the parental heart…  thanks to Mr. Haidt, we can glimpse the true horror of what happened not only in the U.S. but also elsewhere in the English-speaking world… lucid, memorable… galvanizing.” —<i>Wall Street Journal</i><br /><br />"[An] important new book...The shift in kids’ energy and attention from the physical world to the virtual one, Haidt shows, has been catastrophic, especially for girls." —Michelle Goldberg, </b><i>
  <b>The New York Times</b>
</i><br /><br />After more than a decade of stability or improvement, the mental health of adolescents plunged in the early 2010s. Rates of depression, anxiety, self-harm, and suicide rose sharply, more than doubling on many measures. Why?<br /><br />In <i>The Anxious Generation</i>, social psychologist Jonathan Haidt lays out the facts about the epidemic of teen mental illness that hit many countries at the same time. He then investigates the nature of childhood, including why children need play and independent exploration to mature into competent, thriving adults. Haidt shows how the “play-based childhood” began to decline in the 1980s, and how it was finally wiped out by the arrival of the “phone-based childhood” in the early 2010s. He presents more than a dozen mechanisms by which this “great rewiring of childhood” has interfered with children’s social and neurological development, covering everything from sleep deprivation to attention fragmentation, addiction, loneliness, social contagion, social comparison, and perfectionism. He explains why social media damages girls more than boys and why boys have been withdrawing from the real world into the virtual world, with disastrous consequences for themselves, their families, and their societies.<br /><br />Most important, Haidt issues a clear call to action. He diagnoses the “collective action problems” that trap us, and then proposes four simple rules that might set us free. He describes steps that parents, teachers, schools, tech companies, and governments can take to end the epidemic of mental illness and restore a more humane childhood.<br /><br />Haidt has spent his career speaking truth backed by data in the most difficult landscapes—communities polarized by politics and religion, campuses battling culture wars, and now the public health emergency faced by Gen Z. We cannot afford to ignore his findings about protecting our children—and ourselves—from the psychological damage of a phone-based life.]]></book_description>

    <user_review><![CDATA[Must read. I have been applying the main hack in this book for several weeks and can feel a meaningful difference. I'm not sure how I never knew before that order of food mattered so much! While there are a lot of useful hacks (as she calls them) in here, it mostly stems from the insight that it helps curb your glocose spikes a ton by eating food in the order of: fiber (veggies), then proteins, then carbs. And if you think about it, this is not a new insight - eg so many cultures have a pattern of starter salads for this reason. <br /><br /><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/notes/59761779-glucose-revolution/1-otis-chandler/d8d9ef97-f91b-49a5-9f48-5653291cb452?ref=rnlp" rel="nofollow noopener">"Nature intended us to consume glucose in a specific way: in plants. Wherever there was starch or sugar, there was fiber as well. This is important, because the fiber helped to slow our body’s absorption of glucose."</a><br /><br /><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/notes/59761779-glucose-revolution/1-otis-chandler/9a3eb078-75d1-4e61-85ee-0ed6918ac834?ref=rnlp" rel="nofollow noopener">"if you eat the items of a meal containing starch, fiber, sugar, protein, and fat in a specific order, you reduce your overall glucose spike by 73 percent, as well as your insulin spike by 48 percent. This is true for anyone, with or without diabetes. What is the right order? It’s fiber first, protein and fat second, starches and sugars last."</a><br /><br />Reading this, I realized that I sometimes (not always) have a bad habit of starting with carbs on my plate. Or snacking on just carbs. Especially when I'm hungry, it takes a lot of willpower. But now I find it just takes the knowledge that I shouldn't do that because of how harmful it is and how much *better* I feel after eating carbs last! Hardest to do when hungry in a restaurant when they serve you bread and dinner is still 10-20min away. So my new hack: ask for a starter salad right away!<br /><br />Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and starting your day with a glucose spike is a guaranteed way to feel bloated and terrible all day. I've known this, and her hacks help how to do it, by mixing in veggies and proteins to offset any carbs you might eat. If you think about it, most people eat the wrong stuff for breakfast - just go look at the breakfast spread at any nice hotel - full of carbs! The below quote is a good reminder for me as my kids are still cereal monsters:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/notes/59761779-glucose-revolution/1-otis-chandler/b0466586-08cb-41c9-874b-d0a75a623bd8?ref=rnlp" rel="nofollow noopener">"But now, thanks to continuous glucose monitors and curious scientists—which I’ll tell you about next—we have proof that cereal for breakfast is definitely, unequivocally not a good way to start the day."</a><br /><br />Hacks I'm liking:<br />* Ordering a side salad and eating it first at any meal out. Esp at a burger/fries place, etc.<br />* Before starting the protein fill up on veggies from your plate. I was too often leaving them for last!<br />* If you must eat carbs for breakfast, eg pancakes, eat some protein (eg an egg or some yogurt) first.<br />* If you eat carbs for a snack, a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar reduces your spike. Also add vinegar to rice or salad dressing or veggies or anything in the meal helps.<br />* After a big meal have some tea with vinegar mixed in.<br />* If you eat dessert do it right after the meal and not 2hrs later. No midnight sweets! Also go for a walk or danceathon or do some weights or move your body after. <br /><br />I wish she had spent more time on how to eat around workouts. As a triathlete and weightlifter, I'm active a lot and know I need a lot of carbs before and during larger efforts. Generally it will be worked off so I think it's not as big of a deal, but I am curious what she'd say about pure carb workout things like gels. <br /><br /><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/notes/59761779-glucose-revolution/1-otis-chandler/8ce80800-05b2-4f28-8a3a-1706477133ac?ref=rnlp" rel="nofollow noopener">"Resistance exercise (weight lifting) has been shown to decrease the glucose spike by up to 30 percent and the size of further spikes over the following 24 hours by 35 percent. It’s rare that you’ll be able to curb the entire glucose spike, but you can make a sizable dent in it."</a><br /><br />Finally, I'll say that Jessie has gotten a lot of pushback on social media, because she's playing in a space with a lot of different facts as to what is true. Eg I saw <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dr_idz/reel/Cr3gqC5IIl-/" rel="nofollow noopener">a person saying that she said oatmeal is bad for you and that wasn't true, and thus she doesn't know what she's talking about</a>. But if you read her <a href="https://www.glucosegoddess.com/savoury-breakfast-guide" rel="nofollow noopener">breakfast guide</a> (which you should!) you'll see that oats are glucose, and thus to make them into a healthy breakfast you need to add fibers and proteins and then they are fine. So, context was dropped. <br /><br />Also, I think she does most of her glucose experiments on herself or from other community members, so it's not like each piece will apply to everyone. I think she could be more clear as to where things were individual and where they apply to everyone or have been proven with studies. But that being said, her methodology on her main hack of food ordering is true despite that. <br /><br />A good one to keep in mind for those moments you can't resist: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/notes/59761779-glucose-revolution/1-otis-chandler/36ac3545-82aa-469f-9ae5-782055857b73?ref=rnlp" rel="nofollow noopener">"Now you know the amazing combo for snacking on something sweet without incurring a big glucose spike in your body: vinegar before, exercise after."</a>]]></user_review>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Aboard the Vociferous Carmichael, puppeteer John Chandagnac is sailing toward Jamaica to claim his stolen birthright from an unscrupulous uncle, when the vessel is captured . . . by pirates! Offered a choice by Captain Phil Davies to join their seafaring band or die, Chandagnac assumes the name John Shandy and a new life as a brigand. But more than swashbuckling sea battles and fabulous plunder await the novice buccaneer on the roiling Caribbean waters–for treachery and powerful vodun sorcery are coins of the realm in this dark new world. And for the love of beautiful, magically imperiled Beth Hurwood, Shandy will set sail on even stranger tides, following the savage, ghost-infested pirate king, Blackbeard, and a motley crew of the living and the dead to the cursed nightmare banks of the fabled Fountain of Youth.]]></book_description>
